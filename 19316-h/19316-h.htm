<h2><a name="pagevi" id="pagevi"></a><a class="pagebreak" name="pagevii" id="pagevii" title="vii"></a>PREFACE</h2>

<p class="italic">This book of verse for boys is, I believe, the first of its
kind in English. Plainly, it were labour lost to go gleaning
where so many experts have gone harvesting; and for
what is rarest and best in English Poetry the world must
turn, as heretofore, to the several &lsquo;Golden Treasuries&rsquo; of
Professor Palgrave and Mr. Coventry Patmore, and to the
excellent &lsquo;Poets' Walk&rsquo; of Mr. Mowbray Morris. My
purpose has been to choose and sheave a certain number of
those achievements in verse which, as expressing the simpler
sentiments and the more elemental emotions, might fitly be
addressed to such boys&mdash;and men, for that matter&mdash;as are
privileged to use our noble English tongue.</p>

<p class="italic">To set forth, as only art can, the beauty and the joy of
living, the beauty and the blessedness of death, the glory of
battle and adventure, the nobility of devotion&mdash;to a cause,
an ideal, a passion even&mdash;the dignity of resistance, the
sacred quality of patriotism, that is my ambition here.
Now, to read poetry at all is to have an ideal anthology of
one's own, and in that possession to be incapable of content
with the anthologies of all the world besides. That is, the
personal equation is ever to be reckoned withal, and I have
had my preferences, as those that went before me had theirs.
I have omitted much, as Aytoun's &lsquo;Lays,&rsquo; whose absence
<a class="pagebreak" name="pageviii" id="pageviii" title="viii"></a>
many will resent; I have included much, as that brilliant
piece of doggerel of Frederick Marryat's, whose presence
some will regard with distress. This without reference to
enforcements due to the very nature of my work.</p>

<p class="italic">I have adopted the birth-day order: for that is the simplest.
And I have begun with&mdash;not Chaucer, nor Spenser,
nor the ballads, but&mdash;Shakespeare and Agincourt; for it
seemed to me that a book of heroism could have no better
starting-point than that heroic pair of names. As for the
ballads, I have placed them, after much considering, in the
gap between old and new, between classic and romantic, in
English verse. The witness of Sidney and Drayton's example
notwithstanding, it is not until 1765, when Percy
publishes the &lsquo;Reliques,&rsquo; that the ballad spirit begins to be
the master influence that Wordsworth confessed it was;
while as for the history of the matter, there are who hold
that &lsquo;Sir Patrick Spens,&rsquo; for example, is the work of Lady
Wardlaw, which to others, myself among them, is a thing
preposterous and distraught.</p>

<p class="italic">It remains to add that, addressing myself to boys, I have
not scrupled to edit my authors where editing seemed desirable,
and that I have broken up some of the longer pieces
for convenience in reading. Also, the help I have received
while this book of &lsquo;Noble Numbers&rsquo; was in course of growth&mdash;help
in the way of counsel, suggestion, remonstrance, permission
to use&mdash;has been such that it taxes gratitude and
makes complete acknowledgment impossible.</p>

<h2><small><a href="#note_i">I</a></small><br />AGINCOURT</h2>

<h3>INTROIT</h3>

<p><span class="i0">O for a Muse of fire, that would ascend</span><br />
<span class="i0">The brightest heaven of invention,</span><br />
<span class="i0">A kingdom for a stage, princes to act</span><br />
<span class="i0">And monarchs to behold the swelling scene!</span><br />
<span class="i0">Then should the warlike Harry, like himself,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Assume the port of Mars; and at his heels,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Leashed in like hounds, should Famine, Sword and Fire</span><br />
<span class="i0">Crouch for employment. But pardon, gentles all,</span><br />
<span class="i0">The flat unrais&egrave;d spirits that have dared</span><br />
<span class="i0">On this unworthy scaffold to bring forth</span><br />
<span class="i0">So great an object. Can this cockpit hold</span><br />
<span class="i0">The vasty fields of France? or may we cram</span><br />
<span class="i0">Within this wooden O the very casques</span><br />
<span class="i0">That did affright the air at Agincourt?</span><br />
<span class="i0">O pardon! since a crooked figure may</span><br />
<span class="i0">Attest in little place a million,</span><br />
<span class="i0">And let us, ciphers to this great accompt,</span><br />
<span class="i0">On your imaginary forces work.</span><br />
<span class="i0">Suppose within the girdle of these walls</span><br />
<span class="i0">Are now confined two mighty monarchies,</span><br />
<a class="pagebreak" name="page2" id="page2" title="2"></a>
<span class="i0">Whose high uprear&egrave;d and abutting fronts</span><br />
<span class="i0">The perilous narrow ocean parts asunder:</span><br />
<span class="i0">Piece out our imperfections with your thoughts;</span><br />
<span class="i0">Into a thousand parts divide one man,</span><br />
<span class="i0">And make imaginary puissance;</span><br />
<span class="i0">Think, when we talk of horses, that you see them</span><br />
<span class="i0">Printing their proud hoofs i' the receiving earth;</span><br />
<span class="i0">For 'tis your thoughts that now must deck our kings,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Carry them here and there, jumping o'er times,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Turning the accomplishment of many years</span><br />
<span class="i0">Into an hour-glass.</span></p>

<h3>INTERLUDE</h3>

<p><span class="i0">Now all the youth of England are on fire,</span><br />
<span class="i0">And silken dalliance in the wardrobe lies:</span><br />
<span class="i0">Now thrive the armourers, and honour's thought</span><br />
<span class="i0">Reigns solely in the breast of every man:</span><br />
<span class="i0">They sell the pasture now to buy the horse,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Following the mirror of all Christian kings,</span><br />
<span class="i0">With wing&egrave;d heels, as English Mercuries:</span><br />
<span class="i0">For now sits Expectation in the air,</span><br />
<span class="i0">And hides a sword from hilts unto the point</span><br />
<span class="i0">With crowns imperial, crowns and coronets,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Promised to Harry and his followers.</span><br />
<span class="i0">The French, advised by good intelligence</span><br />
<span class="i0">Of this most dreadful preparation,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Shake in their fear, and with pale policy</span><br />
<span class="i0">Seek to divert the English purposes.</span><br />
<span class="i0">O England! model to thy inward greatness,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Like little body with a mighty heart,</span><br />
<a class="pagebreak" name="page3" id="page3" title="3"></a>
<span class="i0">What mightst thou do, that honour would thee do,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Were all thy children kind and natural!</span><br />
<span class="i0">But see thy fault: France hath in thee found out</span><br />
<span class="i0">A nest of hollow bosoms, which he fills</span><br />
<span class="i0">With treacherous crowns; and three corrupted men,</span><br />
<span class="i0">One, Richard Earl of Cambridge, and the second,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Henry Lord Scroop of Masham, and the third,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Sir Thomas Grey, knight, of Northumberland,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Have for the gilt of France&mdash;O guilt indeed!&mdash;</span><br />
<span class="i0">Confirmed conspiracy with fearful France;</span><br />
<span class="i0">And by their hands this grace of kings must die,</span><br />
<span class="i0">If hell and treason hold their promises,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Ere he take ship for France, and in Southampton!&mdash;</span></p>

<h3>HARFLEUR</h3>

<p><span class="i0">Thus with imagined wing our swift scene flies</span><br />
<span class="i0">In motion of no less celerity</span><br />
<span class="i0">Than that of thought. Suppose that you have seen</span><br />
<span class="i0">The well-appointed king at Hampton Pier</span><br />
<span class="i0">Embark his royalty, and his brave fleet</span><br />
<span class="i0">With silken streamers the young Ph&oelig;bus fanning:</span><br />
<span class="i0">Play with your fancies, and in them behold</span><br />
<span class="i0">Upon the hempen tackle ship-boys climbing;</span><br />
<span class="i0">Hear the shrill whistle which doth order give</span><br />
<span class="i0">To sounds confused; behold the threaden sails,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Borne with the invisible and creeping wind</span><br />
<span class="i0">Draw the huge bottoms through the furrowed sea</span><br />
<span class="i0">Breasting the lofty surge. O, do but think</span><br />
<span class="i0">You stand upon the rivage and behold</span><br />
<span class="i0">A city on the inconstant billows dancing!</span><br />
<a class="pagebreak" name="page4" id="page4" title="4"></a>
<span class="i0">For so appears this fleet majestical,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Holding due course to Harfleur. Follow, follow:</span><br />
<span class="i0">Grapple your minds to sternage of this navy,</span><br />
<span class="i0">And leave your England, as dead midnight still,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Guarded with grandsires, babies and old women,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Or passed or not arrived to pith and puissance;</span><br />
<span class="i0">For who is he, whose chin is but enriched</span><br />
<span class="i0">With one appearing hair, that will not follow</span><br />
<span class="i0">These culled and choice-drawn cavaliers to France?</span><br />
<span class="i0">Work, work your thoughts, and therein see a siege:</span><br />
<span class="i0">Behold the ordnance on their carriages,</span><br />
<span class="i0">With fatal mouths gaping on girded Harfleur.</span><br />
<span class="i0">Suppose the ambassador from the French comes back;</span><br />
<span class="i0">Tells Harry that the king doth offer him</span><br />
<span class="i0">Katharine his daughter, and with her to dowry</span><br />
<span class="i0">Some petty and unprofitable dukedoms.</span><br />
<span class="i0">The offer likes not: and the nimble gunner</span><br />
<span class="i0">With linstock now the devilish cannon touches,</span><br />
<span class="i0">And down goes all before them!</span></p>

<h3>THE EVE</h3>

<p><span class="i0">Now entertain conjecture of a time</span><br />
<span class="i0">When creeping murmur and the poring dark</span><br />
<span class="i0">Fills the wide vessel of the universe.</span><br />
<span class="i0">From camp to camp through the foul womb of night</span><br />
<span class="i0">The hum of either army stilly sounds,</span><br />
<span class="i0">That the fixed sentinels almost receive</span><br />
<span class="i0">The secret whispers of each other's watch:</span><br />
<span class="i0">Fire answers fire, and through their paly flames</span><br />
<span class="i0">Each battle sees the other's umbered face;</span><br />
<a class="pagebreak" name="page5" id="page5" title="5"></a>
<span class="i0">Steed threatens steed, in high and boastful neighs</span><br />
<span class="i0">Piercing the night's dull ear, and from the tents</span><br />
<span class="i0">The armourers, accomplishing the knights,</span><br />
<span class="i0">With busy hammers closing rivets up,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Give dreadful note of preparation.</span><br />
<span class="i0">The country cocks do crow, the clocks do toll,</span><br />
<span class="i0">And the third hour of drowsy morning name.</span><br />
<span class="i0">Proud of their numbers and secure in soul,</span><br />
<span class="i0">The confident and over-lusty French</span><br />
<span class="i0">Do the low-rated English play at dice,</span><br />
<span class="i0">And chide the cripple, tardy-gaited night</span><br />

<span class="i0">Bids them good-morrow with a modest smile,</span><br />

<span class="i0">Upon his royal face there is no note</span><br />

<span class="i0">With cheerful semblance and sweet majesty,</span><br />

<span class="i0">A largess universal like the sun</span><br />

<span class="i0">Skirmishing day by day</span><br />
<span class="i0">With those that stopped his way,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Where the French gen'ral lay</span><br />

<span class="i0">That with the cries they make</span><br />
<span class="i0">The very earth did shake,</span><br />

<span class="i0">Whose shouts and claps out-voice the deep-mouthed sea,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Which like a mighty whiffler 'fore the king</span><br />
<span class="i0">Seems to prepare his way: so let him land,</span><br />
<span class="i0">And solemnly see him set on to London.</span><br />
<span class="i0">So swift a pace hath thought that even now</span><br />
<a class="pagebreak" name="page11" id="page11" title="11"></a>
<span class="i0">You may imagine him upon Blackheath;</span><br />
<span class="i0">Where that his lords desire him to have borne</span><br />
<span class="i0">His bruis&egrave;d helmet and his bended sword</span><br />
<span class="i0">Before him through the city: he forbids it,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Being free from vainness and self-glorious pride,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Giving full trophy, signal and ostent,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Quite from himself to God. But now behold,</span><br />
<span class="i0">In the quick forge and working-house of thought,</span><br />
<span class="i0">How London doth pour out her citizens!</span><br />

<span class="i0">Together both, ere the high lawns appeared</span><br />
<span class="i0">Under the opening eyelids of the morn,</span><br />
<span class="i0">We drove afield, and both together heard</span><br />
<span class="i0">What time the grey-fly winds her sultry horn</span><br />

<span class="i0">Where your old bards, the famous Druids, lie,</span><br />

<span class="i0">Down the swift Hebrus to the Lesbian shore?</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;Alas! what boots it with incessant care</span><br />
<span class="i0">To tend the homely slighted shepherd's trade,</span><br />

<span class="i0">He asked the waves, and asked the felon winds,</span><br />
<span class="i0">What hard mishap hath doomed this gentle swain?</span><br />

<span class="i0">Visit'st the bottom of the monstrous world;</span><br />
<span class="i0">Or whether thou, to our moist vows denied,</span><br />

<span class="i0">Where the great vision of the guarded mount</span><br />
<span class="i0">Looks toward Namancos and Bayona's hold;</span><br />
<span class="i0">Look homeward, Angel, now, and melt with ruth:</span><br />
<span class="i0">And, O ye dolphins, waft the hapless youth.</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;Weep no more, woeful shepherds, weep no more,</span><br />
<span class="i0">For Lycidas, your sorrow, is not dead,</span><br />

<span class="i0">So sinks the day-star in the ocean bed,</span><br />
<span class="i0">And yet anon repairs his drooping head,</span><br />
<span class="i0">And tricks his beams, and with new spangled ore</span><br />
<span class="i0">Flames in the forehead of the morning sky:</span><br />
<span class="i0">So Lycidas sunk low, but mounted high,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Through the dear might of Him that walked the waves,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Where, other groves and other streams along,</span><br />
<span class="i0">With nectar pure his oozy locks he laves,</span><br />
<span class="i0">And hears the unexpressive nuptial song,</span><br />

<span class="i0">Henceforth thou art the genius of the shore</span><br />
<span class="i0">In thy large recompense, and shalt be good</span><br />
<span class="i0">To all that wander in that perilous flood.</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus sang the uncouth swain to the oaks and rills,</span><br />
<span class="i0">While the still morn went out with sandals grey;</span><br />
<span class="i0">He touched the tender stops of various quills,</span><br />
<span class="i0">With eager thought warbling his Doric lay:</span><br />
<span class="i0">And now the sun had stretched out all the hills,</span><br />
<span class="i0">And now was dropt into the western bay:</span><br />

<span class="i0">He cast (of which we rather boast)</span><br />
<span class="i0">The Gospel's pearl upon our coast,</span><br />

<span class="i0">'Till it arrive at heaven's vault,</span><br />

<span class="i5">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amid the tuneful quire,</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;With flying fingers touched the lyre:</span><br />

<span class="i4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And heavenly joys inspire.</span><br />
<span class="i2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The song began from Jove</span><br />
<span class="i2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who left his blissful seats above,</span><br />
<span class="i2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such is the power of mighty love!</span><br />
<span class="i2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A dragon's fiery form belied the god;</span><br />
<span class="i2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sublime on radiant spires he rode</span><br />
<span class="i2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he to fair Olympia pressed,</span><br />
<span class="i2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And while he sought her snowy breast,</span><br />

<span class="i0">And stamped an image of himself, a sovereign of the world.</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;The listening crowd admire the lofty sound;</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;A present deity! they shout around:</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;A present deity! the vaulted roofs rebound:</span><br />

<span class="i2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sound the trumpets, beat the drums!</span><br />
<span class="i3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Flushed with a purple grace</span><br />

<p><span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;Soothed with the sound the king grew vain;</span><br />
<span class="i3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fought all his battles o'er again,</span><br />

<span class="i4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He chose a mournful Muse</span><br />

<span class="i3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Deserted at his utmost need</span><br />
<span class="i3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By those his former bounty fed,</span><br />
<span class="i3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the bare earth exposed he lies</span><br />
<span class="i3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With not a friend to close his eyes.</span><br />
<span class="i0">With downcast looks the joyless victor sate,</span><br />

<a class="pagebreak" name="page43" id="page43" title="43"></a>

<span class="i5">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And tears began to flow.</span></p>

<p><span class="i2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mighty master smiled to see</span><br />
<span class="i2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That love was in the next degree;</span><br />
<span class="i2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Twas but a kindred-sound to move,</span><br />

<span class="i3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Softly sweet, in Lydian measures</span><br />
<span class="i3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Soon he soothed his soul to pleasures.</span><br />
<span class="i2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;War, he sang, is toil and trouble,</span><br />

<span class="i3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lovely Thais sits beside thee,</span><br />
<span class="i3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Take the good the gods provide thee.</span><br />
<span class="i0">The many rend the skies with loud applause;</span><br />
<span class="i0">So love was crowned, but Music won the cause.</span><br />
<span class="i2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The prince, unable to conceal his pain,</span><br />
<span class="i5">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gazed on the fair</span><br />
<span class="i5">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who caused his care,</span><br />
<span class="i2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And sighed and looked, sighed and looked,</span><br />
<span class="i2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sighed and looked, and sighed again:</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;At length, with love and wine at once oppressed,</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;The vanquished victor sunk upon her breast.</span></p>

<p><span class="i2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now strike the golden lyre again:</span><br />
<span class="i2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A louder yet, and yet a louder strain!</span><br />

<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;To kill and bear away.</span><br />

<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;In Scotland where he lay:</span></p>

<p><span class="i0">Who sent Erle Percy present word,</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;He wold prevent his sport.</span><br />
<span class="i0">The English Erle, not fearing that,</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;Did to the woods resort</span></p>

<p><a class="pagebreak" name="page48" id="page48" title="48"></a>
<span class="i0">With fifteen hundred bow-men bold,</span><br />

<span class="i0">Who knew full well in time of neede</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;To ayme their shafts aright.</span></p>

<p><span class="i0">The gallant greyhounds swiftly ran,</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;To chase the fallow deere:</span><br />
<span class="i0">On Monday they began to hunt,</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;Ere daylight did appeare;</span></p>

<p><span class="i0">And long before high noone they had</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;An hundred fat buckes slaine;</span><br />
<span class="i0">Then having dined, the drovyers went</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;To rouse the deere againe.</span></p>

<p><span class="i0">The bow-men mustered on the hills,</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;Well able to endure;</span><br />
<span class="i0">Their backsides all, with special care</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;That day were guarded sure.</span></p>

<p><span class="i0">The hounds ran swiftly through the woods,</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;The nimble deere to take,</span><br />
<span class="i0">And with their cryes the hills and dales</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;An echo shrill did make.</span></p>

<p><span class="i0">Lord Percy to the quarry went,</span><br />

<p><span class="i0">That ever did on horsebacke come,</span><br />

<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;That hunt so boldly here,</span><br />
<span class="i0">That, without my consent, do chase</span><br />

<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;Thy chiefest harts to slay.&rsquo;</span><br />
<span class="i0">Then Douglas swore a solemn oath,</span><br />

<span class="i0">Any of these our guiltlesse men,</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;For they have done no ill.</span></p>

<p><span class="i0">Let thou and I the battell trye,</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;And set our men aside.&rsquo;</span><br />
<span class="i0">&lsquo;Accurst be he,&rsquo; Erle Percy said,</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;By whom this is denied.&rsquo;</span></p>

<p><span class="i0">Then stept a gallant squier forth,</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;Witherington was his name,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Who said, &lsquo;I wold not have it told</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;To Henry our king for shame,</span></p>

<p><span class="i0">That ere my captaine fought on foote,</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;And I stood looking on.</span><br />
<span class="i0">Ye be two erles,&rsquo; said Witherington,</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;And I a squier alone:</span></p>

<p><span class="i0">Ile do the best that do I may,</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;While I have power to stand:</span><br />
<a class="pagebreak" name="page51" id="page51" title="51"></a>
<span class="i0">While I have power to wield my sword,</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;Ile fight with heart and hand.&rsquo;</span></p>

<h3>THE BATTLE</h3>

<p><span class="i0">Our English archers bent their bowes,</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;Their hearts were good and trew,</span><br />
<span class="i0">At the first flight of arrowes sent,</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;Full fourscore Scots they slew.</span></p>

<p><span class="i0">Yet bides Erle Douglas on the bent,</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;As Chieftain stout and good.</span><br />
<span class="i0">As valiant Captain, all unmoved</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;The shock he firmly stood.</span></p>

<p><span class="i0">His host he parted had in three,</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;As leader ware and try'd,</span><br />
<span class="i0">And soon his spearmen on their foes</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;Bare down on every side.</span></p>

<p><span class="i0">Throughout the English archery</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;They dealt full many a wound;</span><br />
<span class="i0">But still our valiant Englishmen</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;All firmly kept their ground,</span></p>

<p><span class="i0">And, throwing strait their bowes away,</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;They grasped their swords so bright,</span><br />
<span class="i0">And now sharp blows, a heavy shower,</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;On shields and helmets light.</span></p>

<p><span class="i0">They closed full fast on every side,</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;No slackness there was found;</span><br />
<span class="i0">And many a gallant gentleman</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;Lay gasping on the ground.</span></p>

<p><a class="pagebreak" name="page52" id="page52" title="52"></a>
<span class="i0">O Christ! it was a griefe to see,</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;And likewise for to heare,</span><br />
<span class="i0">The cries of men lying in their gore,</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;And scattered here and there!</span></p>

<p><span class="i0">At last these two stout erles did meet,</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;Like captaines of great might:</span><br />
<span class="i0">Like lions wode, they laid on lode,</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;And made a cruel fight:</span></p>

<p><span class="i0">They fought untill they both did sweat</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;With swords of tempered steele;</span><br />
<span class="i0">Until the blood like drops of rain</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;They trickling downe did feele.</span></p>

<p><span class="i0">&lsquo;Yield thee, Lord Percy,&rsquo; Douglas said;</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;In faith I will thee bringe,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Where thou shalt high advanc&egrave;d be</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;By James our Scottish king:</span></p>

<p><span class="i0">Thy ransome I will freely give,</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;And this report of thee,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Thou art the most courageous knight,</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;That ever I did see.&rsquo;</span></p>

<p><span class="i0">&lsquo;No, Douglas,&rsquo; quoth Erle Percy then,</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;Thy proffer I do scorne;</span><br />
<span class="i0">I will not yield to any Scot,</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;That ever yet was borne.&rsquo;</span></p>

<p><span class="i0">With that, there came an arrow keene</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;Out of an English bow,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Which struck Erle Douglas to the heart,</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;A deep and deadly blow:</span></p>

<p><a class="pagebreak" name="page53" id="page53" title="53"></a>
<span class="i0">Who never spake more words than these,</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;Fight on, my merry men all;</span><br />
<span class="i0">For why, my life is at an end;</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;Lord Percy sees my fall.&rsquo;</span></p>

<p><span class="i0">Then leaving life, Erle Percy tooke</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;The dead man by the hand;</span><br />
<span class="i0">And said, &lsquo;Erle Douglas, for thy life</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;Wold I had lost my land!</span></p>

<p><span class="i0">O Christ! my very heart doth bleed</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;With sorrow for thy sake,</span><br />
<span class="i0">For sure, a more redoubted knight</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;Mischance could never take.&rsquo;</span></p>

<p><span class="i0">A knight amongst the Scots there was,</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;Which saw Erle Douglas dye,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Who straight in wrath did vow revenge</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon the Lord Percye.</span></p>

<p><span class="i0">Sir Hugh Mountgomery was he called</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;Who, with a speare most bright,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Well-mounted on a gallant steed,</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;Ran fiercely through the fight,</span></p>

<p><span class="i0">And past the English archers all,</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;Without or dread or feare,</span><br />
<span class="i0">And through Erle Percy's body then</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;He thrust his hateful speare.</span></p>

<p><span class="i0">With such a vehement force and might</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;He did his body gore,</span><br />
<span class="i0">The staff ran through the other side</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;A large cloth-yard, and more.</span></p>

<p><a class="pagebreak" name="page54" id="page54" title="54"></a>
<span class="i0">So thus did both these nobles dye,</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;Whose courage none could staine!</span><br />
<span class="i0">An English archer then perceived</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;The noble Erle was slaine:</span></p>

<p><span class="i0">He had a bow bent in his hand,</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;Made of a trusty tree;</span><br />
<span class="i0">An arrow of a cloth-yard long</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;Up to the head drew he;</span></p>

<p><span class="i0">Against Sir Hugh Mountgomerye</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;So right the shaft he set,</span><br />
<span class="i0">The grey goose-winge that was thereon</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;In his heart's bloode was wet.</span></p>

<p><span class="i0">This fight did last from breake of day</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;Till setting of the sun;</span><br />
<span class="i0">For when they rung the evening-bell,</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;The battle scarce was done.</span></p>

<h3>THE SLAIN</h3>

<p><span class="i0">With stout Erle Percy, there was slaine</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir John of Egerton,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Sir Robert Ratcliff, and Sir John,</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir James, that bold bar&ograve;n;</span></p>

<p><span class="i0">And with Sir George and stout Sir James,</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;Both knights of good account,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Good Sir Ralph Raby there was slaine,</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;Whose prowesse did surmount.</span></p>

<p><span class="i0">For Witherington needs must I wayle,</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;As one in doleful dumpes;</span><br />
<a class="pagebreak" name="page55" id="page55" title="55"></a>
<span class="i0">For when his legs were smitten off,</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;He fought upon his stumpes.</span></p>

<p><span class="i0">And with Erle Douglas, there was slaine</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir Hugh Mountgomerye,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Sir Charles Murray, that from the field</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;One foote would never flee;</span></p>

<p><span class="i0">Sir Charles Murray, of Ratcliff, too,</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;His sister's sonne was he;</span><br />
<span class="i0">Sir David Lamb, so well esteemed,</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet saved he could not be;</span></p>

<p><span class="i0">And the Lord Maxwell in like case</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;Did with Erle Douglas dye:</span><br />
<span class="i0">Of twenty hundred Scottish speares,</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;Scarce fifty-five did flye.</span></p>

<p><span class="i0">Of fifteen hundred Englishmen,</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;Went home but fifty-three:</span><br />
<span class="i0">The rest were slaine in Chevy-Chace,</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the greene woode tree.</span></p>

<p><span class="i0">Next day did many widdowes come,</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;Their husbands to bewayle;</span><br />
<span class="i0">They washt their wounds in brinish teares,</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;But all wold not prevayle;</span></p>

<p><span class="i0">Their bodyes, bathed in purple gore,</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;They bore with them away;</span><br />
<span class="i0">They kist them dead a thousand times,</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;Ere they were clad in clay.</span></p>

<h3><a class="pagebreak" name="page56" id="page56" title="56"></a>THE TIDINGS</h3>

<p><span class="i0">The newes was brought to Eddenborrow,</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;Where Scotland's king did raigne,</span><br />
<span class="i0">That brave Erle Douglas suddenlye</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;Was with an arrow slaine:</span></p>

<p><span class="i0">&lsquo;O heavy newes,&rsquo; King James did say,</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;Scotland may witnesse be,</span><br />
<span class="i0">I have not any captaine more</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;Of such account as he.&rsquo;</span></p>

<p><span class="i0">Like tydings to King Henry came,</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;Within as short a space,</span><br />
<span class="i0">That Percy of Northumberland</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;Was slaine in Chevy-Chace:</span></p>

<p><span class="i0">&lsquo;Now God be with him,&rsquo; said our king,</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;Sith it will no better be;</span><br />
<span class="i0">I trust I have, within my realme,</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;Five hundred as good as he:</span></p>

<p><span class="i0">Yet shall not Scots nor Scotland say,</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;But I will vengeance take:</span><br />
<span class="i0">I'll be reveng&egrave;d on them all,</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;For brave Erle Percy's sake.&rsquo;</span></p>

<p><span class="i0">This vow full well the king performed</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;After, at Humbledowne;</span><br />
<span class="i0">In one day, fifty knights were slayne,</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;With lords of great renowne,</span></p>

<p><span class="i0">And of the rest, of small account,</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;Did many thousands dye.</span><br />
<a class="pagebreak" name="page57" id="page57" title="57"></a>
<span class="i0">Thus endeth the hunting of Chevy-Chace,</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;Made by the Erle Percye.</span></p>

<p><span class="i0">God save our king, and bless this land</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;With plentye, joy, and peace,</span><br />

<p><span class="i0">The fifteenth day of July,</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;With glistering spear and shield,</span><br />
<span class="i0">A famous fight in Flanders</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;Was foughten in the field:</span><br />
<a class="pagebreak" name="page61" id="page61" title="61"></a>
<span class="i0">The most conspicuous officers</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;Were English captains three,</span><br />

<p><span class="i0">The next was Captain Norris,</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;A valiant man was he:</span><br />

<span class="i0">And then upon dead horses</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;Full savourly they eat,</span><br />
<span class="i0">And drank the puddle water,</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;That could no better get.</span></p>

<p><span class="i0">When they had fed so freely,</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;They kneel&egrave;d on the ground,</span><br />
<span class="i0">And prais&egrave;d God devoutly</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;For the favour they had found;</span><br />
<span class="i0">And bearing up their colours,</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;The fight they did renew,</span><br />
<span class="i0">And cutting tow'rds the Spaniard,</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;Five thousand more they slew.</span></p>

<p><span class="i0">The sharp steel-pointed arrows</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;And bullets thick did fly;</span><br />
<span class="i0">Then did our valiant soldiers</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;Charge on most furiously:</span><br />
<span class="i0">Which made the Spaniards waver,</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;They thought it best to flee:</span><br />
<span class="i0">They feared the stout behaviour</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;Of brave Lord Willoughby.</span></p>

<p><span class="i0">Then quoth the Spanish general,</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;Come, let us march away,</span><br />
<span class="i0">I fear we shall be spoil&egrave;d all</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;If that we longer stay:</span><br />
<a class="pagebreak" name="page63" id="page63" title="63"></a>
<span class="i0">For yonder comes Lord Willoughby</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;With courage fierce and fell,</span><br />
<span class="i0">He will not give one inch of ground</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;For all the devils in hell.&rsquo;</span></p>

<p><span class="i0">And when the fearful enemy</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;Was quickly put to flight,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Our men pursued courageously</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;To rout his forces quite;</span><br />
<span class="i0">And at last they gave a shout</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;Which echoed through the sky:</span><br />
<span class="i0">&lsquo;God, and St. George for England!&rsquo;</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;The conquerors did cry.</span></p>

<p><span class="i0">This news was brought to England</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;With all the speed might be,</span><br />
<span class="i0">And soon our gracious Queen was told</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;Of this same victory.</span><br />
<span class="i0">&lsquo;O! this is brave Lord Willoughby,</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;My love that ever won:</span><br />
<span class="i0">Of all the lords of honour</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;'Tis he great deeds hath done!&rsquo;</span></p>

<p><span class="i0">To the soldiers that were maim&egrave;d,</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;And wounded in the fray,</span><br />
<span class="i0">The queen allowed a pension</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;Of fifteen pence a day,</span><br />
<span class="i0">And from all costs and charges</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;She quit and set them free:</span><br />
<span class="i0">And this she did all for the sake</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;Of brave Lord Willoughby.</span></p>

<p><a class="pagebreak" name="page64" id="page64" title="64"></a>
<span class="i0">Then courage, noble Englishmen,</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;And never be dismayed!</span><br />
<span class="i0">If that we be but one to ten,</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;We will not be afraid</span><br />
<span class="i0">To fight with foreign enemies,</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;And set our country free.</span><br />
<span class="i0">And thus I end the bloody bout</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;Of brave Lord Willoughby.</span></p>

<h3>THE CAPTURE</h3>

<p><span class="i0">O have ye na heard o' the fause Sakelde?</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;O have ye na heard o' the keen Lord Scroope?</span><br />
<span class="i0">How they hae ta'en bold Kinmont Willie,</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;On Haribee to hang him up?</span></p>

<p><a class="pagebreak" name="page67" id="page67" title="67"></a>
<span class="i0">Had Willie had but twenty men,</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;But twenty men as stout as he,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Fause Sakelde had never the Kinmont ta'en,</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;Wi' eight score in his cumpanie.</span></p>

<p><span class="i0">They band his legs beneath the steed,</span><br />

<p><span class="i0">&lsquo;My hands are tied, but my tongue is free,</span><br />

<p><span class="i0">O is my basnet a widow's curch?</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;Or my lance a wand of the willow-tree?</span><br />
<span class="i0">Or my arm a lady's lily hand,</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;That an English lord should lightly me!</span></p>

<p><span class="i0">And have they ta'en him, Kinmont Willie,</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;Against the truce of Border tide?</span><br />

<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;Is keeper here on the Scottish side?</span></p>

<p><span class="i0">And have they e'en ta'en him, Kinmont Willie,</span><br />

<p><span class="i0">I would set that castle in a lowe,</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;And slocken it with English blood!</span><br />
<span class="i0">There's never a man in Cumberland</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;Should ken where Carlisle castle stood.</span></p>

<p><span class="i0">But since nae war's between the lands,</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;And there is peace, and peace should be,</span><br />
<a class="pagebreak" name="page69" id="page69" title="69"></a>
<span class="i0">I'll neither harm English lad or lass,</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;And yet the Kinmont freed shall be!&rsquo;</span></p>

<h3>THE MARCH</h3>

<p><span class="i0">He has called him forty Marchmen bold,</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;I trow they were of his ain name,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Except Sir Gilbert Elliot, called</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;The Laird of Stobs, I mean the same.</span></p>

<p><span class="i0">He has called him forty Marchmen bold,</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;Were kinsmen to the bold Buccleuch;</span><br />
<span class="i0">With spur on heel, and splent on spauld,</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;And gluves of green, and feathers blue.</span></p>

<p><span class="i0">There were five and five before them a',</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;Wi' hunting-horns and bugles bright:</span><br />
<span class="i0">And five and five cam' wi' Buccleuch,</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;Like warden's men, arrayed for fight.</span></p>

<p><span class="i0">And five and five like a mason gang</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;That carried the ladders lang and hie;</span><br />
<span class="i0">And five and five like broken men;</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;And so they reached the Woodhouselee.</span></p>

<p><span class="i0">And as we crossed the 'Bateable Land,</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;When to the English side we held,</span><br />
<span class="i0">The first o' men that we met wi',</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;Whae suld it be but fause Sakelde?</span></p>

<p><span class="i0">&lsquo;Where be ye gaun, ye hunters keen?&rsquo;</span><br />

<span class="i0">&lsquo;We go to hunt an English stag</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;Has trespassed on the Scots countrie.&rsquo;</span></p>

<p><a class="pagebreak" name="page70" id="page70" title="70"></a>
<span class="i0">&lsquo;Where be ye gaun, ye marshal men?&rsquo;</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;Quo' fause Sakelde; &lsquo;come tell me true!&rsquo;</span><br />
<span class="i0">&lsquo;We go to catch a rank reiver</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;Has broken faith wi' the bold Buccleuch.&rsquo;</span></p>

<p><span class="i0">&lsquo;Where are ye gaun, ye mason lads,</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;Wi' a' your ladders lang and hie?&rsquo;</span><br />
<span class="i0">&lsquo;We gang to herry a corbie's nest</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;That wons not far frae Woodhouselee.&rsquo;</span></p>

<p><span class="i0">&lsquo;Where be ye gaun, ye broken men?&rsquo;</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;Quo' fause Sakelde; &lsquo;come tell to me!&rsquo;</span><br />
<span class="i0">Now Dickie of Dryhope led that band,</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;And the never a word of lear had he.</span></p>

<p><span class="i0">&lsquo;Why trespass ye on the English side?</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;Row-footed outlaws, stand!&rsquo; quo' he;</span><br />
<span class="i0">The never a word had Dickie to say,</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;Sae he thrust the lance through his fause bodie.</span></p>

<p><span class="i0">Then on we held for Carlisle toun,</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;And at Staneshaw-Bank the Eden we crossed;</span><br />
<span class="i0">The water was great and meikle of spait,</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;But the never a horse nor man we lost.</span></p>

<p><span class="i0">And when we reached the Staneshaw-Bank,</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;The wind was rising loud and hie;</span><br />
<span class="i0">And there the Laird garred leave our steeds,</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;For fear that they should stamp and neigh.</span></p>

<p><span class="i0">And when we left the Staneshaw-Bank,</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;The wind began full loud to blaw;</span><br />
<span class="i0">But 'twas wind and weet, and fire and sleet,</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;When we came beneath the castle wa'.</span></p>

<p><a class="pagebreak" name="page71" id="page71" title="71"></a>
<span class="i0">We crept on knees, and held our breath,</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;Till we placed the ladders against the wa';</span><br />
<span class="i0">And sae ready was Buccleuch himsell</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;To mount the first before us a'.</span></p>

<p><span class="i0">He has ta'en the watchman by the throat,</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;He flung him down upon the lead:</span><br />
<span class="i0">&lsquo;Had there not been peace between our lands,</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon the other side thou'dst gaed!</span></p>

<p><span class="i0">Now sound out, trumpets!&rsquo; quo' Buccleuch;</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;Let's waken Lord Scroope right merrilie!&rsquo;</span><br />
<span class="i0">Then loud the warden's trumpet blew</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>O wha dare meddle wi' me?</i></span></p>

<h3>THE RESCUE</h3>

<p><span class="i0">Then speedilie to wark we gaed,</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;And raised the slogan ane and a',</span><br />
<span class="i0">And cut a hole through a sheet of lead,</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;And so we wan to the castle ha'.</span></p>

<p><span class="i0">They thought King James and a' his men</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;Had won the house wi' bow and spear;</span><br />
<span class="i0">It was but twenty Scots and ten</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;That put a thousand in sic a stear!</span></p>

<p><span class="i0">Wi' coulters and wi' forehammers</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;We garred the bars bang merrilie,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Until we came to the inner prison,</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;Where Willie o' Kinmont he did lie.</span></p>

<p><span class="i0">And when we cam' to the lower prison,</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;Where Willie o' Kinmont he did lie:</span><br />
<a class="pagebreak" name="page72" id="page72" title="72"></a>
<span class="i0">&lsquo;O sleep ye, wake ye, Kinmont Willie,</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon the morn that thou's to die?&rsquo;</span></p>

<p><span class="i0">&lsquo;O I sleep saft, and I wake aft;</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;It's lang since sleeping was fleyed frae me!</span><br />
<span class="i0">Gie my service back to my wife and bairns,</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;And a' gude fellows that spier for me.&rsquo;</span></p>

<p><span class="i0">Then Red Rowan has hente him up,</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;The starkest man in Teviotdale:</span><br />
<span class="i0">&lsquo;Abide, abide now, Red Rowan,</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;Till of my Lord Scroope I take farewell.</span></p>

<p><span class="i0">Farewell, farewell, my gude Lord Scroope!</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;My gude Lord Scroope, farewell!&rsquo; he cried;</span><br />
<span class="i0">&lsquo;I'll pay you for my lodging maill,</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;When first we meet on the Border side.&rsquo;</span></p>

<p><span class="i0">Then shoulder high with shout and cry</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;We bore him down the ladder lang;</span><br />
<span class="i0">At every stride Red Rowan made,</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;I wot the Kinmont's airns played clang.</span></p>

<p><span class="i0">&lsquo;O mony a time,&rsquo; quo' Kinmont Willie,</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;I have ridden horse baith wild and wood;</span><br />
<span class="i0">But a rougher beast than Red Rowan</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;I ween my legs have ne'er bestrode.</span></p>

<p><span class="i0">And mony a time,&rsquo; quo' Kinmont Willie,</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;I've pricked a horse out oure the furs;</span><br />
<span class="i0">But since the day I backed a steed,</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;I never wore sic cumbrous spurs!&rsquo;</span></p>

<p><span class="i0">We scarce had won the Staneshaw-Bank</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;When a' the Carlisle bells were rung,</span><br />
<a class="pagebreak" name="page73" id="page73" title="73"></a>
<span class="i0">And a thousand men on horse and foot</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;Cam' wi' the keen Lord Scroope along.</span></p>

<p><span class="i0">Buccleuch has turned to Eden Water,</span><br />

<span class="i0">Of a battle fought upon the seas</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;By a ship of brave command.</span><br />
<span class="i0">The fight it was so glorious</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;Men's hearts it did ful-fill,</span><br />
<span class="i0">And it made them cry, &lsquo;To sea, to sea,</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;With the Angel Gabriel!&rsquo;</span></p>

<p><a class="pagebreak" name="page74" id="page74" title="74"></a>
<span class="i0">This lusty ship of Bristol</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;Sailed out adventurously</span><br />
<span class="i0">Against the foes of England,</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;Her strength with them to try;</span><br />
<span class="i0">Well victualled, rigged, and manned she was,</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;With good provision still,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Which made men cry, &lsquo;To sea, to sea,</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;With the Angel Gabriel!&rsquo;</span></p>

<p><span class="i0">The Captain, famous Netherway</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;(That was his noble name):</span><br />
<span class="i0">The Master&mdash;he was called John Mines&mdash;</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;A mariner of fame:</span><br />
<span class="i0">The Gunner, Thomas Watson,</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;A man of perfect skill:</span><br />
<span class="i0">With many another valiant heart</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Angel Gabriel.</span></p>

<p><span class="i0">They waving up and down the seas</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon the ocean main,</span><br />
<span class="i0">&lsquo;It is not long ago,&rsquo; quoth they,</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;That England fought with Spain:</span><br />
<span class="i0">O would the Spaniard we might meet</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;Our stomachs to fulfil!</span><br />
<span class="i0">We would play him fair a noble bout</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;With our Angel Gabriel!&rsquo;</span></p>

<p><span class="i0">They had no sooner spoken</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;But straight appeared in sight</span><br />
<span class="i0">Three lusty Spanish vessels</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;Of warlike trim and might;</span><br />
<a class="pagebreak" name="page75" id="page75" title="75"></a>
<span class="i0">With bloody resolution</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;They thought our men to spill,</span><br />
<span class="i0">And they vowed that they would make a prize</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;Of our Angel Gabriel.</span></p>

<p><span class="i0">Our gallant ship had in her</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;Full forty fighting men:</span><br />
<span class="i0">With twenty piece of ordnance</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;We played about them then,</span><br />
<span class="i0">With powder, shot, and bullets</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;Right well we worked our will,</span><br />
<span class="i0">And hot and bloody grew the fight</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;With our Angel Gabriel.</span></p>

<p><span class="i0">Our Captain to our Master said,</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;Take courage, Master bold!&rsquo;</span><br />
<span class="i0">Our Master to the seamen said,</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;Stand fast, my hearts of gold!&rsquo;</span><br />
<span class="i0">Our Gunner unto all the rest,</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;Brave hearts, be valiant still!</span><br />
<span class="i0">Fight on, fight on in the defence</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;Of our Angel Gabriel!&rsquo;</span></p>

<p><span class="i0">We gave them such a broadside,</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;It smote their mast asunder,</span><br />
<span class="i0">And tore the bowsprit off their ship,</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;Which made the Spaniards wonder,</span><br />
<span class="i0">And caus&egrave;d them in fear to cry,</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;With voices loud and shrill,</span><br />
<span class="i0">&lsquo;Help, help, or sunken we shall be</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;By the Angel Gabriel!&rsquo;</span></p>

<p><a class="pagebreak" name="page76" id="page76" title="76"></a>
<span class="i0">So desperately they boarded us</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;For all our valiant shot,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Threescore of their best fighting men</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon our decks were got;</span><br />
<span class="i0">And lo! at their first entrances</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;Full thirty did we kill,</span><br />
<span class="i0">And thus we cleared with speed the deck</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;Of our Angel Gabriel.</span></p>

<p><span class="i0">With that their three ships boarded us</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;Again with might and main,</span><br />
<span class="i0">But still our noble Englishmen</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;Cried out, &lsquo;A fig for Spain!&rsquo;</span><br />
<span class="i0">Though seven times they boarded us</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;At last we showed our skill,</span><br />
<span class="i0">And made them feel what men we were</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;On the Angel Gabriel.</span></p>

<p><span class="i0">Seven hours this fight continued:</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;So many men lay dead,</span><br />
<span class="i0">With Spanish blood for fathoms round</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;The sea was coloured red.</span><br />
<span class="i0">Five hundred of their fighting men</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;We there outright did kill,</span><br />
<span class="i0">And many more were hurt and maimed</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;By our Angel Gabriel.</span></p>

<p><span class="i0">Then, seeing of these bloody spoils,</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;The rest made haste away:</span><br />
<span class="i0">For why, they said, it was no boot</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;The longer there to stay.</span><br />
<a class="pagebreak" name="page77" id="page77" title="77"></a>
<span class="i0">Then they fled into Cal&egrave;s,</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;Where lie they must and will</span><br />
<span class="i0">For fear lest they should meet again</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;With our Angel Gabriel.</span></p>

<p><span class="i0">We had within our English ship</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;But only three men slain,</span><br />
<span class="i0">And five men hurt, the which I hope</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;Will soon be well again.</span><br />
<span class="i0">At Bristol we were landed,</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;And let us praise God still,</span><br />

<h3>THE MARCH</h3>

<p><span class="i0">Next morn the Baron climbed the tower,</span><br />
<span class="i0">To view afar the Scottish power</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;Encamped on Flodden edge:</span><br />
<span class="i0">The white pavilions made a show,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Like remnants of the winter snow,</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;Along the dusky ridge.</span><br />
<span class="i0">Long Marmion looked: at length his eye</span><br />
<span class="i0">Unusual movement might descry</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;Amid the shifting lines:</span><br />
<span class="i0">The Scottish host drawn out appears,</span><br />
<span class="i0">For flashing on the hedge of spears</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;The eastern sunbeam shines.</span><br />
<span class="i0">Their front now deepening, now extending;</span><br />
<span class="i0">Their flank inclining, wheeling, bending,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Now drawing back, and now descending,</span><br />
<span class="i0">The skilful Marmion well could know,</span><br />
<span class="i0">They watched the motions of some foe</span><br />
<span class="i0">Who traversed on the plain below.</span></p>

<p><span class="i0">Even so it was. From Flodden ridge</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;The Scots beheld the English host</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;Leave Barmore-wood, their evening post,</span><br />
<a class="pagebreak" name="page115" id="page115" title="115"></a>
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;And heedful watched them as they crossed</span><br />
<span class="i0">The Till by Twisel bridge.</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;High sight it is and haughty, while</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;They dive into the deep defile;</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;Beneath the caverned cliff they fall,</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;Beneath the castle's airy wall.</span><br />
<span class="i0">By rock, by oak, by hawthorn-tree,</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;Troop after troop are disappearing;</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;Troop after troop their banners rearing</span><br />
<span class="i0">Upon the eastern bank you see.</span><br />
<span class="i0">Still pouring down the rocky den,</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;Where flows the sullen Till,</span><br />
<span class="i0">And rising from the dim-wood glen,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Standards on standards, men on men,</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;In slow succession still,</span><br />
<span class="i0">And sweeping o'er the Gothic arch,</span><br />
<span class="i0">And pressing on in ceaseless march,</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;To gain the opposing hill.</span><br />
<span class="i0">That morn to many a trumpet clang,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Twisel! thy rocks deep echo rang;</span><br />
<span class="i0">And many a chief of birth and rank,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Saint Helen! at thy fountain drank.</span><br />
<span class="i0">Thy hawthorn glade, which now we see</span><br />
<span class="i0">In spring-tide bloom so lavishly,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Had then from many an axe its doom,</span><br />
<span class="i0">To give the marching columns room.</span></p>

<p><span class="i0">And why stands Scotland idly now,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Dark Flodden! on thy airy brow,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Since England gains the pass the while,</span><br />
<span class="i0">And struggles through the deep defile?</span><br />
<a class="pagebreak" name="page116" id="page116" title="116"></a>
<span class="i0">What checks the fiery soul of James?</span><br />
<span class="i0">Why sits that champion of the dames</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;Inactive on his steed,</span><br />
<span class="i0">And sees between him and his land,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Between him and Tweed's southern strand,</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;His host Lord Surrey lead?</span><br />
<span class="i0">What 'vails the vain knight-errant's brand?</span><br />
<span class="i0">O, Douglas, for thy leading wand!</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;Fierce Randolph, for thy speed!</span><br />
<span class="i0">O for one hour of Wallace wight,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Or well-skilled Bruce, to rule the fight,</span><br />
<span class="i0">And cry &lsquo;Saint Andrew and our right!&rsquo;</span><br />
<span class="i0">Another sight had seen that morn,</span><br />
<span class="i0">From Fate's dark book a leaf been torn,</span><br />
<span class="i0">And Flodden had been Bannockburn!</span><br />
<span class="i0">The precious hour has passed in vain,</span><br />
<span class="i0">And England's host has gained the plain;</span><br />
<span class="i0">Wheeling their march, and circling still,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Around the base of Flodden hill.</span></p>

<h3>THE ATTACK</h3>

<p><span class="i0">&lsquo;But see! look up&mdash;on Flodden bent</span><br />
<span class="i0">The Scottish foe has fired his tent.&rsquo;</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;And sudden, as he spoke,</span><br />
<span class="i0">From the sharp ridges of the hill,</span><br />
<span class="i0">All downward to the banks of Till</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;Was wreathed in sable smoke.</span><br />
<span class="i0">Volumed and fast, and rolling far,</span><br />
<span class="i0">The cloud enveloped Scotland's war,</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;As down the hill they broke;</span><br />
<a class="pagebreak" name="page117" id="page117" title="117"></a>
<span class="i0">Nor martial shout nor minstrel tone</span><br />
<span class="i0">Announced their march; their tread alone,</span><br />
<span class="i0">At times one warning trumpet blown,</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;At times a stifled hum,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Told England, from his mountain-throne</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;King James did rushing come.</span><br />
<span class="i0">Scarce could they hear, or see their foes,</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;Until at weapon-point they close.</span><br />
<span class="i0">They close in clouds of smoke and dust,</span><br />
<span class="i0">With sword-sway and with lance's thrust;</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;And such a yell was there</span><br />
<span class="i0">Of sudden and portentous birth,</span><br />
<span class="i0">As if men fought upon the earth</span><br />
<span class="i0">And fiends in upper air;</span><br />
<span class="i0">O life and death were in the shout,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Recoil and rally, charge and rout,</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;And triumph and despair.</span><br />
<span class="i0">Long looked the anxious squires; their eye</span><br />
<span class="i0">Could in the darkness nought descry.</span></p>

<p><span class="i0">At length the freshening western blast</span><br />
<span class="i0">Aside the shroud of battle cast;</span><br />
<span class="i0">And first the ridge of mingled spears</span><br />
<span class="i0">Above the brightening cloud appears;</span><br />
<span class="i0">And in the smoke the pennons flew,</span><br />
<span class="i0">As in the storm the white sea-mew.</span><br />
<span class="i0">Then marked they, dashing broad and far,</span><br />
<span class="i0">The broken billows of the war,</span><br />
<span class="i0">And plum&egrave;d crests of chieftains brave</span><br />
<span class="i0">Floating like foam upon the wave;</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;But nought distinct they see:</span><br />
<a class="pagebreak" name="page118" id="page118" title="118"></a>
<span class="i0">Wide raged the battle on the plain;</span><br />
<span class="i0">Spears shook, and falchions flashed amain;</span><br />
<span class="i0">Fell England's arrow-flight like rain;</span><br />
<span class="i0">Crests rose, and stooped, and rose again,</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;Wild and disorderly.</span><br />
<span class="i0">Amid the scene of tumult, high</span><br />
<span class="i0">They saw Lord Marmion's falcon fly:</span><br />
<span class="i0">And stainless Tunstall's banner white</span><br />
<span class="i0">And Edmund Howard's lion bright</span><br />
<span class="i0">Still bear them bravely in the fight:</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;Although against them come</span><br />
<span class="i0">Of gallant Gordons many a one,</span><br />
<span class="i0">And many a stubborn Badenoch-man,</span><br />
<span class="i0">And many a rugged Border clan,</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;With Huntly and with Home.</span></p>

<p><span class="i0">Far on the left, unseen the while,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Stanley broke Lennox and Argyle;</span><br />
<span class="i0">Though there the western mountaineer</span><br />
<span class="i0">Rushed with bare bosom on the spear,</span><br />
<span class="i0">And flung the feeble targe aside,</span><br />
<span class="i0">And with both hands the broadsword plied.</span><br />
<span class="i0">'Twas vain: but Fortune, on the right,</span><br />
<span class="i0">With fickle smile cheered Scotland's fight.</span><br />
<span class="i0">Then fell that spotless banner white,</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;The Howard's lion fell;</span><br />
<span class="i0">Yet still Lord Marmion's falcon flew</span><br />
<span class="i0">With wavering flight, while fiercer grew</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;Around the battle-yell.</span><br />
<span class="i0">The Border slogan rent the sky!</span><br />
<span class="i0">A Home! a Gordon! was the cry:</span><br />
<a class="pagebreak" name="page119" id="page119" title="119"></a>
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;Loud were the clanging blows;</span><br />
<span class="i0">Advanced, forced back, now low, now high,</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;The pennon sank and rose;</span><br />
<span class="i0">As bends the bark's mast in the gale,</span><br />
<span class="i0">When rent are rigging, shrouds, and sail,</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;It wavered 'mid the foes.</span></p>

<h3>THE LAST STAND</h3>

<p><span class="i0">By this, though deep the evening fell,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Still rose the battle's deadly swell,</span><br />
<span class="i0">For still the Scots, around their King,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Unbroken, fought in desperate ring.</span><br />
<span class="i0">Where's now their victor vaward wing,</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;Where Huntly, and where Home?</span><br />
<span class="i0">O for a blast of that dread horn,</span><br />
<span class="i0">On Fontarabian echoes borne,</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;That to King Charles did come,</span><br />
<span class="i0">When Roland brave, and Olivier,</span><br />
<span class="i0">And every paladin and peer,</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;On Roncesvalles died!</span><br />
<span class="i0">Such blast might warn them, not in vain,</span><br />
<span class="i0">To quit the plunder of the slain,</span><br />
<span class="i0">And turn the doubtful day again,</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;While yet on Flodden side</span><br />
<span class="i0">Afar the Royal Standard flies,</span><br />
<span class="i0">And round it toils, and bleeds, and dies</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;Our Caledonian pride!</span></p>

<p><span class="i0">But as they left the dark'ning heath,</span><br />
<span class="i0">More desperate grew the strife of death.</span><br />
<a class="pagebreak" name="page120" id="page120" title="120"></a>
<span class="i0">The English shafts in volleys hailed,</span><br />
<span class="i0">In headlong charge their horse assailed;</span><br />
<span class="i0">Front, flank, and rear, the squadrons sweep</span><br />
<span class="i0">To break the Scottish circle deep</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;That fought around their King.</span><br />
<span class="i0">But yet, though thick the shafts as snow,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Though charging knights like whirlwinds go,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Though bill-men ply the ghastly blow,</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;Unbroken was the ring;</span><br />
<span class="i0">The stubborn spear-men still made good</span><br />
<span class="i0">Their dark impenetrable wood,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Each stepping where his comrade stood,</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;The instant that he fell.</span><br />
<span class="i0">No thought was there of dastard flight;</span><br />
<span class="i0">Linked in the serried phalanx tight,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Groom fought like noble, squire like knight,</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;As fearlessly and well;</span><br />
<span class="i0">Till utter darkness closed her wing</span><br />
<span class="i0">O'er their thin host and wounded King.</span><br />
<span class="i0">Then skilful Surrey's sage commands</span><br />
<span class="i0">Led back from strife his shattered bands;</span><br />
<span class="i0">And from the charge they drew,</span><br />
<span class="i0">As mountain waves from wasted lands</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;Sweep back to ocean blue.</span><br />

<p><span class="i0">The stag at eve had drunk his fill,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Where danced the moon on Monan's rill,</span><br />
<span class="i0">And deep his midnight lair had made</span><br />
<span class="i0">In lone Glenartney's hazel shade;</span><br />
<span class="i0">But, when the sun his beacon red</span><br />
<span class="i0">Had kindled on Benvoirlich's head,</span><br />
<span class="i0">The deep-mouthed bloodhound's heavy bay</span><br />
<span class="i0">Resounded up the rocky way,</span><br />
<span class="i0">And faint from farther distance borne</span><br />
<span class="i0">Were heard the clanging hoof and horn.</span></p>

<p><span class="i0">As Chief, who hears his warder call,</span><br />
<span class="i0">&lsquo;To arms! the foemen storm the wall,&rsquo;</span><br />
<span class="i0">The antlered monarch of the waste</span><br />
<span class="i0">Sprang from his heathery couch in haste.</span><br />
<a class="pagebreak" name="page122" id="page122" title="122"></a>
<span class="i0">But, ere his fleet career he took,</span><br />
<span class="i0">The dew-drops from his flanks he shook;</span><br />
<span class="i0">Like crested leader proud and high,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Tossed his beamed frontlet to the sky;</span><br />
<span class="i0">A moment gazed adown the dale,</span><br />
<span class="i0">A moment snuffed the tainted gale,</span><br />
<span class="i0">A moment listened to the cry</span><br />
<span class="i0">That thickened as the chase drew nigh;</span><br />
<span class="i0">Then, as the headmost foes appeared,</span><br />
<span class="i0">With one brave bound the copse he cleared,</span><br />
<span class="i0">And, stretching forward free and far,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Sought the wild heaths of Uam-Var.</span></p>

<p><span class="i0">Yelled on the view the opening pack;</span><br />
<span class="i0">Rock, glen, and cavern paid them back:</span><br />
<span class="i0">To many a mingled sound at once</span><br />
<span class="i0">The awakened mountain gave response.</span><br />
<span class="i0">A hundred dogs bayed deep and strong,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Clattered a hundred steeds along,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Their peal the merry horns rang out,</span><br />
<span class="i0">A hundred voices joined the shout;</span><br />
<span class="i0">With hark and whoop and wild halloo</span><br />
<span class="i0">No rest Benvoirlich's echoes knew.</span><br />
<span class="i0">Far from the tumult fled the roe,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Close in her covert cowered the doe,</span><br />
<span class="i0">The falcon from her cairn on high</span><br />
<span class="i0">Cast on the rout a wondering eye,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Till far beyond her piercing ken</span><br />
<span class="i0">The hurricane had swept the glen.</span><br />
<span class="i0">Faint and more faint, its failing din</span><br />
<span class="i0">Returned from cavern, cliff, and linn,</span><br />
<a class="pagebreak" name="page123" id="page123" title="123"></a>
<span class="i0">And silence settled wide and still</span><br />
<span class="i0">On the lone wood and mighty hill.</span></p>

<p><span class="i0">Less loud the sounds of silvan war</span><br />
<span class="i0">Disturbed the heights of Uam-Var,</span><br />
<span class="i0">And roused the cavern where, 'tis told,</span><br />
<span class="i0">A giant made his den of old;</span><br />
<span class="i0">For ere that steep ascent was won,</span><br />
<span class="i0">High in his pathway hung the sun,</span><br />
<span class="i0">And many a gallant, stayed perforce,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Was fain to breathe his faltering horse,</span><br />
<span class="i0">And of the trackers of the deer</span><br />
<span class="i0">Scarce half the lessening pack was near;</span><br />
<span class="i0">So shrewdly on the mountain-side</span><br />
<span class="i0">Had the bold burst their mettle tried.</span></p>

<p><span class="i0">The noble stag was pausing now</span><br />
<span class="i0">Upon the mountain's southern brow,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Where broad extended, far beneath,</span><br />
<span class="i0">The varied realms of fair Menteith.</span><br />
<span class="i0">With anxious eye he wandered o'er</span><br />
<span class="i0">Mountain and meadow, moss and moor,</span><br />
<span class="i0">And pondered refuge from his toil</span><br />
<span class="i0">By far Lochard or Aberfoyle.</span><br />
<span class="i0">But nearer was the copsewood grey</span><br />
<span class="i0">That waved and wept on Loch-Achray,</span><br />
<span class="i0">And mingled with the pine-trees blue</span><br />
<span class="i0">On the bold cliffs of Benvenue.</span><br />
<span class="i0">Fresh vigour with the hope returned,</span><br />
<span class="i0">With flying foot the heath he spurned,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Held westward with unwearied race,</span><br />
<span class="i0">And left behind the panting chase.</span></p>

<p><a class="pagebreak" name="page124" id="page124" title="124"></a>
<span class="i0">'Twere long to tell what steeds gave o'er,</span><br />
<span class="i0">As swept the hunt through Cambus-more;</span><br />
<span class="i0">What reins were tightened in despair,</span><br />
<span class="i0">When rose Benledi's ridge in air;</span><br />
<span class="i0">Who flagged upon Bochastle's heath,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Who shunned to stem the flooded Teith,</span><br />
<span class="i0">For twice that day from shore to shore</span><br />
<span class="i0">The gallant stag swam stoutly o'er.</span><br />
<span class="i0">Few were the stragglers, following far,</span><br />
<span class="i0">That reached the lake of Vennachar;</span><br />
<span class="i0">And when the Brigg of Turk was won,</span><br />
<span class="i0">The headmost horseman rode alone.</span></p>

<p><span class="i0">Alone, but with unbated zeal,</span><br />
<span class="i0">That horseman plied the scourge and steel;</span><br />
<span class="i0">For jaded now and spent with toil,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Embossed with foam and dark with soil,</span><br />
<span class="i0">While every gasp with sobs he drew,</span><br />
<span class="i0">The labouring stag strained full in view.</span><br />
<span class="i0">Two dogs of black Saint Hubert's breed,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Unmatched for courage, breath, and speed,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Fast on his flying traces came</span><br />
<span class="i0">And all but won that desperate game;</span><br />
<span class="i0">For scarce a spear's length from his haunch</span><br />
<span class="i0">Vindictive toiled the bloodhounds staunch;</span><br />
<span class="i0">Nor nearer might the dogs attain,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Nor farther might the quarry strain.</span><br />
<span class="i0">Thus up the margin of the lake,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Between the precipice and brake,</span><br />
<span class="i0">O'er stock and rock their race they take.</span></p>

<p><a class="pagebreak" name="page125" id="page125" title="125"></a>
<span class="i0">The Hunter marked that mountain high,</span><br />
<span class="i0">The lone lake's western boundary,</span><br />
<span class="i0">And deemed the stag must turn to bay</span><br />
<span class="i0">Where that huge rampart barred the way;</span><br />
<span class="i0">Already glorying in the prize,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Measured his antlers with his eyes;</span><br />
<span class="i0">For the death-wound and death-halloo</span><br />
<span class="i0">Mustered his breath, his whinyard drew;</span><br />
<span class="i0">But thundering as he came prepared,</span><br />
<span class="i0">With ready arm and weapon bared,</span><br />
<span class="i0">The wily quarry shunned the shock,</span><br />
<span class="i0">And turned him from the opposing rock;</span><br />
<span class="i0">Then, dashing down a darksome glen,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Soon lost to hound and hunter's ken,</span><br />
<span class="i0">In the deep Trosach's wildest nook</span><br />
<span class="i0">His solitary refuge took.</span><br />
<span class="i0">There, while close couched, the thicket shed</span><br />
<span class="i0">Cold dews and wild-flowers on his head,</span><br />
<span class="i0">He heard the baffled dogs in vain</span><br />
<span class="i0">Rave through the hollow pass amain,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Chiding the rocks that yelled again.</span></p>

<p><span class="i0">Close on the hounds the hunter came,</span><br />
<span class="i0">To cheer them on the vanished game;</span><br />
<span class="i0">But, stumbling in the rugged dell,</span><br />
<span class="i0">The gallant horse exhausted fell.</span><br />
<span class="i0">The impatient rider strove in vain</span><br />
<span class="i0">To rouse him with the spur and rein,</span><br />
<span class="i0">For the good steed, his labours o'er,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Stretched his stiff limbs, to rise no more;</span><br />
<span class="i0">Then touched with pity and remorse</span><br />
<span class="i0">He sorrowed o'er the expiring horse.</span><br />
<a class="pagebreak" name="page126" id="page126" title="126"></a>
<span class="i0">&lsquo;I little thought, when first thy rein</span><br />
<span class="i0">I slacked upon the banks of Seine,</span><br />
<span class="i0">That Highland eagle e'er should feed</span><br />
<span class="i0">On thy fleet limbs, my matchless steed!</span><br />
<span class="i0">Woe worth the chase, woe worth the day,</span><br />
<span class="i0">That costs thy life, my gallant grey!&rsquo;</span></p>

<p><span class="i0">Then through the dell his horn resounds,</span><br />
<span class="i0">From vain pursuit to call the hounds.</span><br />
<span class="i0">Back limped with slow and crippled pace</span><br />
<span class="i0">The sulky leaders of the chase;</span><br />
<span class="i0">Close to their master's side they pressed,</span><br />
<span class="i0">With drooping tail and humbled crest;</span><br />
<span class="i0">But still the dingle's hollow throat</span><br />
<span class="i0">Prolonged the swelling bugle-note.</span><br />
<span class="i0">The owlets started from their dream,</span><br />
<span class="i0">The eagles answered with their scream,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Round and around the sounds were cast,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Till echoes seemed an answering blast;</span><br />

<h2><small><a href="#note_lxiii">LXIII</a></small><br />ROMANCE</h2>

<p><span class="i0">In Xanadu did Kubla Khan</span><br />
<span class="i0">A stately pleasure-dome decree:</span><br />
<span class="i0">Where Alph, the sacred river, ran</span><br />
<span class="i0">Through caverns measureless to man</span><br />
<span class="i0">Down to a sunless sea.</span><br />
<span class="i0">So twice five miles of fertile ground</span><br />
<span class="i0">With walls and towers were girdled round:</span><br />
<span class="i0">And there were gardens bright with sinuous rills</span><br />
<span class="i0">Where blossomed many an incense-bearing tree;</span><br />
<span class="i0">And here were forests ancient as the hills,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Enfolding sunny spots of greenery.</span></p>

<p><span class="i0">But O! that deep romantic chasm which slanted</span><br />
<span class="i0">Down the green hill athwart a cedarn cover!</span><br />
<span class="i0">A savage place! as holy and enchanted</span><br />
<span class="i0">As e'er beneath a waning moon was haunted</span><br />
<span class="i0">By woman wailing for her demon-lover!</span><br />
<a class="pagebreak" name="page137" id="page137" title="137"></a>
<span class="i0">And from this chasm, with ceaseless turmoil seething,</span><br />
<span class="i0">As if this earth in fast thick pants were breathing,</span><br />
<span class="i0">A mighty fountain momently was forced:</span><br />
<span class="i0">Amid whose swift half-intermitted burst</span><br />
<span class="i0">Huge fragments vaulted like rebounding hail,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Or chaffy grain beneath the thresher's flail:</span><br />
<span class="i0">And 'mid these dancing rocks at once and ever</span><br />
<span class="i0">It flung up momently the sacred river.</span><br />
<span class="i0">Five miles meandering with a mazy motion</span><br />
<span class="i0">Through wood and dale the sacred river ran,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Then reached the caverns measureless to man,</span><br />
<span class="i0">And sank in tumult to a lifeless ocean:</span><br />
<span class="i0">And 'mid this tumult Kubla heard from far</span><br />
<span class="i0">Ancestral voices prophesying war!</span></p>

<p><span class="i0">The shadow of the dome of pleasure</span><br />
<span class="i0">Floated midway on the waves;</span><br />
<span class="i0">Where was heard the mingled measure</span><br />
<span class="i0">From the fountain and the caves.</span><br />
<span class="i0">It was a miracle of rare device,</span><br />
<span class="i0">A sunny pleasure-dome with caves of ice!</span><br />
<span class="i0">A damsel with a dulcimer</span><br />
<span class="i0">In a vision once I saw:</span><br />
<span class="i0">It was an Abyssinian maid,</span><br />
<span class="i0">And on her dulcimer she played,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Singing of Mount Abora.</span><br />
<span class="i0">Could I revive within me</span><br />
<span class="i0">Her symphony and song,</span><br />
<span class="i0">To such a deep delight 'twould win me,</span><br />
<span class="i0">That with music loud and long,</span><br />
<span class="i0">I would build that dome in air,</span><br />
<a class="pagebreak" name="page138" id="page138" title="138"></a>
<span class="i0">That sunny dome! those caves of ice!</span><br />
<span class="i0">And all who heard should see them there,</span><br />
<span class="i0">And all should cry, Beware! Beware!</span><br />
<span class="i0">His flashing eyes, his floating hair!</span><br />
<span class="i0">Weave a circle round him thrice,</span><br />
<span class="i0">And close your eyes with holy dread,</span><br />
<span class="i0">For he on honey-dew hath fed,</span><br />
<span class="i0">And drunk the milk of Paradise.</span></p>

<p><span class="i0">Iphigeneia, when she heard her doom</span><br />
<span class="i0">At Aulis, and when all beside the King</span><br />
<span class="i0">Had gone away, took his right hand, and said,</span><br />
<span class="i0">&lsquo;O father! I am young and very happy.</span><br />
<span class="i0">I do not think the pious Calchas heard</span><br />
<span class="i0">Distinctly what the Goddess spake. Old-age</span><br />
<span class="i0">Obscures the senses. If my nurse, who knew</span><br />
<span class="i0">My voice so well, sometimes misunderstood</span><br />
<span class="i0">While I was resting on her knee both arms</span><br />
<span class="i0">And hitting it to make her mind my words,</span><br />
<span class="i0">And looking in her face, and she in mine,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Might he not also hear one word amiss,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Spoken from so far off, even from Olympus?&rsquo;</span><br />
<span class="i0">The father placed his cheek upon her head,</span><br />
<span class="i0">And tears dropt down it, but the king of men</span><br />
<span class="i0">Replied not. Then the maiden spake once more.</span><br />
<span class="i0">&lsquo;O father! say'st thou nothing? Hear'st thou not</span><br />
<span class="i0">Me, whom thou ever hast, until this hour,</span><br />
<a class="pagebreak" name="page139" id="page139" title="139"></a>
<span class="i0">Listened to fondly, and awakened me</span><br />
<span class="i0">To hear my voice amid the voice of birds,</span><br />
<span class="i0">When it was inarticulate as theirs,</span><br />
<span class="i0">And the down deadened it within the nest?&rsquo;</span><br />
<span class="i0">He moved her gently from him, silent still,</span><br />
<span class="i0">And this, and this alone, brought tears from her,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Although she saw fate nearer: then with sighs,</span><br />
<span class="i0">&lsquo;I thought to have laid down my hair before</span><br />
<span class="i0">Benignant Artemis, and not have dimmed</span><br />
<span class="i0">Her polisht altar with my virgin blood;</span><br />
<span class="i0">I thought to have selected the white flowers</span><br />
<span class="i0">To please the Nymphs, and to have asked of each</span><br />
<span class="i0">By name, and with no sorrowful regret,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Whether, since both my parents willed the change,</span><br />
<span class="i0">I might at Hymen's feet bend my clipt brow;</span><br />
<span class="i0">And (after those who mind us girls the most)</span><br />
<span class="i0">Adore our own Athena, that she would</span><br />
<span class="i0">Regard me mildly with her azure eyes.</span><br />
<span class="i0">But, father! to see you no more, and see</span><br />
<span class="i0">Your love, O father! go ere I am gone.&rsquo; ...</span><br />
<span class="i0">Gently he moved her off, and drew her back,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Bending his lofty head far over hers,</span><br />
<span class="i0">And the dark depths of nature heaved and burst.</span><br />
<span class="i0">He turned away; not far, but silent still.</span><br />
<span class="i0">She now first shuddered; for in him, so nigh,</span><br />
<span class="i0">So long a silence seemed the approach of death,</span><br />
<span class="i0">And like it. Once again she raised her voice.</span><br />
<span class="i0">&lsquo;O father! if the ships are now detained,</span><br />
<span class="i0">And all your vows move not the Gods above,</span><br />
<span class="i0">When the knife strikes me there will be one prayer</span><br />
<span class="i0">The less to them: and purer can there be</span><br />
<a class="pagebreak" name="page140" id="page140" title="140"></a>
<span class="i0">Any, or more fervent than the daughter's prayer</span><br />
<span class="i0">For her dear father's safety and success?&rsquo;</span><br />
<span class="i0">A groan that shook him shook not his resolve.</span><br />
<span class="i0">An aged man now entered, and without</span><br />
<span class="i0">One word, stept slowly on, and took the wrist</span><br />
<span class="i0">Of the pale maiden. She looked up, and saw</span><br />
<span class="i0">The fillet of the priest and calm cold eyes.</span><br />
<span class="i0">Then turned she where her parent stood, and cried,</span><br />
<span class="i0">&lsquo;O father! grieve no more: the ships can sail.&rsquo;</span></p>

<span class="i0">Of the sun.</span></p>

<p><span class="i0">Again! again! again!</span><br />
<span class="i0">And the havoc did not slack,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Till a feeble cheer the Dane,</span><br />
<span class="i0">To our cheering sent us back;&mdash;</span><br />
<span class="i0">Their shots along the deep slowly boom:&mdash;</span><br />
<span class="i0">Then cease&mdash;and all is wail,</span><br />
<span class="i0">As they strike the shattered sail;</span><br />
<span class="i0">Or, in conflagration pale</span><br />
<span class="i0">Light the gloom.</span></p>

<p><span class="i0">Now joy, Old England, raise</span><br />
<span class="i0">For the tidings of thy might,</span><br />
<span class="i0">By the festal cities' blaze,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Whilst the wine-cup shines in light;</span><br />

<span class="i0">Without a mark, without a bound,</span><br />
<span class="i0">It runneth the earth's wide regions 'round;</span><br />

<h3>THE SIGNAL</h3>

<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;Lightly and brightly breaks away</span><br />

<a class="pagebreak" name="page152" id="page152" title="152"></a>

<span class="i0">And the flap of the banners that flit as they're borne,</span><br />
<span class="i0">And the neigh of the steed, and the multitude's hum,</span><br />
<span class="i0">And the clash, and the shout, &lsquo;They come! they come!&rsquo;</span><br />
<span class="i0">The horsetails are plucked from the ground, and the sword</span><br />
<span class="i0">From its sheath; and they form, and but wait for the word.</span><br />
<span class="i0">Tartar, and Spahi, and Turcoman,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Strike your tents, and throng to the van;</span><br />
<span class="i0">Mount ye, spur ye, skirr the plain,</span><br />
<span class="i0">That the fugitive may flee in vain,</span><br />
<span class="i0">When he breaks from the town; and none escape,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Aged or young, in the Christian shape;</span><br />
<span class="i0">While your fellows on foot, in a fiery mass,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Bloodstain the breach through which they pass.</span><br />
<span class="i0">The steeds are all bridled, and snort to the rein;</span><br />
<span class="i0">Curved is each neck, and flowing each mane;</span><br />
<span class="i0">White is the foam of their champ on the bit:</span><br />
<span class="i0">The spears are uplifted; the matches are lit;</span><br />
<span class="i0">The cannon are pointed, and ready to roar,</span><br />
<span class="i0">And crush the wall they have crumbled before:</span><br />
<span class="i0">Forms in his phalanx each janizar;</span><br />
<span class="i0">Alp at their head; his right arm is bare,</span><br />
<span class="i0">So is the blade of his scimitar;</span><br />
<span class="i0">The khan and the pachas are all at their post;</span><br />
<span class="i0">The vizier himself at the head of the host.</span><br />
<span class="i0">When the culverin's signal is fired, then on;</span><br />

<h3>THE ASSAULT</h3>

<p><span class="i0">As the spring-tides, with heavy plash,</span><br />
<span class="i0">From the cliffs invading dash</span><br />
<span class="i0">Huge fragments, sapped by the ceaseless flow,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Till white and thundering down they go,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Like the avalanche's snow</span><br />
<span class="i0">On the Alpine vales below;</span><br />
<span class="i0">Thus at length, outbreathed and worn,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Corinth's sons were downward borne</span><br />
<span class="i0">By the long and oft renewed</span><br />
<span class="i0">Charge of the Moslem multitude.</span><br />
<span class="i0">In firmness they stood, and in masses they fell,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Heaped by the host of the infidel,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Hand to hand, and foot to foot:</span><br />
<span class="i0">Nothing there, save death, was mute:</span><br />
<span class="i0">Stroke, and thrust, and flash, and cry</span><br />
<span class="i0">For quarter or for victory,</span><br />
<a class="pagebreak" name="page154" id="page154" title="154"></a>
<span class="i0">Mingle there with the volleying thunder,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Which makes the distant cities wonder</span><br />
<span class="i0">How the sounding battle goes,</span><br />
<span class="i0">If with them, or for their foes;</span><br />
<span class="i0">If they must mourn, or may rejoice</span><br />
<span class="i0">In that annihilating voice,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Which pierces the deep hills through and through</span><br />
<span class="i0">With an echo dread and new:</span><br />
<span class="i0">You might have heard it, on that day,</span><br />
<span class="i0">O'er Salamis and Megara;</span><br />
<span class="i0">(We have heard the hearers say,)</span><br />
<span class="i0">Even unto Pir&aelig;us' bay.</span></p>

<p><span class="i0">From the point of encountering blades to the hilt,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Sabres and swords with blood were gilt;</span><br />
<span class="i0">But the rampart is won, and the spoil begun,</span><br />
<span class="i0">And all but the after carnage done,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Shriller shrieks now mingling come</span><br />
<span class="i0">From within the plundered dome:</span><br />
<span class="i0">Hark to the haste of flying feet</span><br />
<span class="i0">That splash in the blood of the slippery street;</span><br />
<span class="i0">But here and there, where 'vantage ground</span><br />
<span class="i0">Against the foe may still be found,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Desperate groups, of twelve or ten,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Make a pause, and turn again&mdash;</span><br />
<span class="i0">With banded backs against the wall,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Fiercely stand, or fighting fall.</span></p>

<p><span class="i0">There stood an old man&mdash;his hairs were white,</span><br />
<span class="i0">But his veteran arm was full of might:</span><br />
<span class="i0">So gallantly bore he the brunt of the fray,</span><br />
<a class="pagebreak" name="page155" id="page155" title="155"></a>
<span class="i0">The dead before him, on that day,</span><br />
<span class="i0">In a semicircle lay;</span><br />
<span class="i0">Still he combated unwounded,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Though retreating, unsurrounded.</span><br />
<span class="i0">Many a scar of former fight</span><br />
<span class="i0">Lurked beneath his corselet bright;</span><br />
<span class="i0">But of every wound his body bore,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Each and all had been ta'en before:</span><br />
<span class="i0">Though aged, he was so iron of limb,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Few of our youth could cope with him,</span><br />
<span class="i0">And the foes, whom he singly kept at bay,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Outnumbered his thin hairs of silver grey.</span><br />
<span class="i0">From right to left his sabre swept;</span><br />
<span class="i0">Many an Othman mother wept</span><br />
<span class="i0">Sons that were unborn, when dipped</span><br />
<span class="i0">His weapon first in Moslem gore,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Ere his years could count a score.</span><br />
<span class="i0">Of all he might have been the sire</span><br />
<span class="i0">Who fell that day beneath his ire:</span><br />
<span class="i0">For, sonless left long years ago,</span><br />
<span class="i0">His wrath made many a childless foe;</span><br />
<span class="i0">And since the day, when in the strait</span><br />
<span class="i0">His only boy had met his fate,</span><br />
<span class="i0">His parent's iron hand did doom</span><br />
<span class="i0">More than a human hecatomb.</span><br />
<span class="i0">If shades by carnage be appeased,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Patroclus' spirit less was pleased</span><br />
<span class="i0">Than his, Minotti's son, who died</span><br />
<span class="i0">Where Asia's bounds and ours divide.</span><br />
<span class="i0">Buried he lay, where thousands before</span><br />
<span class="i0">For thousands of years were inhumed on the shore;</span><br />
<a class="pagebreak" name="page156" id="page156" title="156"></a>
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;What of them is left, to tell</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;Where they lie, and how they fell?</span><br />
<span class="i0">Not a stone on their turf, nor a bone in their graves;</span><br />
<span class="i0">But they live in the verse that immortally saves.</span></p>

<h3>THE MAGAZINE</h3>

<span class="i0">Minotti stood o'er the altar-stone:</span><br />
<span class="i0">Madonna's face upon him shone,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Painted in heavenly hues above,</span><br />
<span class="i0">With eyes of light and looks of love;</span><br />
<span class="i0">And placed upon that holy shrine</span><br />
<span class="i0">To fix our thoughts on things divine,</span><br />
<span class="i0">When pictured there, we kneeling see</span><br />
<span class="i0">Her, and the boy-God on her knee,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Smiling sweetly on each prayer</span><br />
<span class="i0">To heaven, as if to waft it there.</span><br />
<span class="i0">Still she smiled; even now she smiles,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Though slaughter streams along her aisles:</span><br />
<span class="i0">Minotti lifted his aged eye,</span><br />
<span class="i0">And made the sign of a cross with a sigh,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Then seized a torch which blazed thereby;</span><br />
<span class="i0">And still he stood, while with steel and flame</span><br />
<span class="i0">Inward and onward the Mussulman came.</span></p>

<p><span class="i0">The vaults beneath the mosaic stone</span><br />
<span class="i0">Contained the dead of ages gone;</span><br />

<a class="pagebreak" name="page158" id="page158" title="158"></a>
<span class="i0">That morn it held the holy wine,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Converted by Christ to his blood so divine,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Which his worshippers drank at the break of day,</span><br />
<span class="i0">To shrive their souls ere they joined in the fray.</span><br />
<span class="i0">Still a few drops within it lay;</span><br />

<span class="i0">All that of living or dead remain,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Hurl'd on high with the shivered fane,</span><br />

<span class="i0">The shattered town&mdash;the walls thrown down&mdash;</span><br />
<span class="i0">The waves a moment backward bent&mdash;</span><br />

<span class="i0">All blackened there and reeking lay.</span><br />
<span class="i0">All the living things that heard</span><br />

<span class="i0">The bull-frog's note from out the marsh</span><br />
<span class="i0">Deep-mouthed arose, and doubly harsh;</span><br />
<span class="i0">The wolves yelled on the caverned hill</span><br />
<span class="i0">Where echo rolled in thunder still;</span><br />
<span class="i0">The jackals' troop in gathered cry</span><br />

<span class="i0">With a mixed and mournful sound,</span><br />

<span class="i0">The clouds beneath him seemed so dun;</span><br />
<span class="i0">Their smoke assailed his startled beak,</span><br />

<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;Should suffer wrong no more.</span><br />
<span class="i0">By the Nine Gods he swore it,</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;And named a trysting day,</span><br />
<span class="i0">And bade his messengers ride forth</span><br />
<span class="i0">East and west and south and north</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;To summon his array.</span></p>

<p><a class="pagebreak" name="page180" id="page180" title="180"></a>
<span class="i0">East and west and south and north</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;The messengers ride fast,</span><br />
<span class="i0">And tower and town and cottage</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;Have heard the trumpet's blast.</span><br />
<span class="i0">Shame on the false Etruscan</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;Who lingers in his home,</span><br />
<span class="i0">When Porsena of Clusium</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;Is on the march for Rome.</span></p>

<p><span class="i0">The horsemen and the footmen</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;Are pouring in amain</span><br />
<span class="i0">From many a stately market-place,</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;From many a fruitful plain;</span><br />
<span class="i0">From many a lonely hamlet</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;Which, hid by beech and pine,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Like an eagle's nest hangs on the crest</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;Of purple Apennine;</span></p>

<p><span class="i0">From lordly Volaterr&aelig;,</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;Where scowls the far-famed hold</span><br />
<span class="i0">Piled by the hands of giants</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;For godlike kings of old;</span><br />
<span class="i0">From sea-girt Populonia</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;Whose sentinels descry</span><br />
<span class="i0">Sardinia's snowy mountain-tops</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;Fringing the southern sky;</span></p>

<p><span class="i0">From the proud mart of Pis&aelig;,</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;Queen of the western waves,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Where ride Massilia's triremes</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;Heavy with fair-haired slaves;</span><br />
<a class="pagebreak" name="page181" id="page181" title="181"></a>
<span class="i0">From where sweet Clanis wanders</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;Through corn and vines and flowers;</span><br />
<span class="i0">From where Cortona lifts to heaven</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;Her diadem of towers.</span></p>

<p><span class="i0">Tall are the oaks whose acorns</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;Drop in dark Auser's rill;</span><br />
<span class="i0">Fat are the stags that champ the boughs</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the Ciminian hill;</span><br />
<span class="i0">Beyond all streams Clitumnus</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;Is to the herdsman dear;</span><br />
<span class="i0">Best of all pools the fowler loves</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;The great Volsinian mere.</span></p>

<p><span class="i0">But now no stroke of woodman</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;Is heard by Auser's rill;</span><br />
<span class="i0">No hunter tracks the stag's green path</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;Up the Ciminian hill;</span><br />
<span class="i0">Unwatched along Clitumnus</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;Grazes the milk-white steer;</span><br />

<p><span class="i0">The harvests of Arretium</span><br />

<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;This year the must shall foam</span><br />
<span class="i0">Round the white feet of laughing girls</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;Whose sires have marched to Rome.</span></p>

<p><a class="pagebreak" name="page182" id="page182" title="182"></a>
<span class="i0">There be thirty chosen prophets,</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;The wisest of the land,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Who alway by Lars Porsena</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;Both morn and evening stand:</span><br />
<span class="i0">Evening and morn the Thirty</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;Have turned the verses o'er,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Traced from the right on linen white</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;By mighty seers of yore.</span></p>

<p><span class="i0">And with one voice the Thirty</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;Have their glad answer given:</span><br />
<span class="i0">&lsquo;Go forth, go forth, Lars Porsena;</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;Go forth, beloved of Heaven;</span><br />
<span class="i0">Go, and return in glory</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;To Clusium's royal dome,</span><br />
<span class="i0">And hang round Nurscia's altars</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;The golden shields of Rome.&rsquo;</span></p>

<p><span class="i0">And now hath every city</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;Sent up her tale of men;</span><br />
<span class="i0">The foot are fourscore thousand,</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;The horse are thousands ten.</span><br />
<span class="i0">Before the gates of Sutrium</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;Is met the great array.</span><br />
<span class="i0">A proud man was Lars Porsena</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon the trysting day!</span></p>

<p><span class="i0">For all the Etruscan armies</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;Were ranged beneath his eye,</span><br />
<span class="i0">And many a banished Roman,</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;And many a stout ally;</span><br />
<a class="pagebreak" name="page183" id="page183" title="183"></a>
<span class="i0">And with a mighty following</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;To join the muster came</span><br />
<span class="i0">The Tusculan Mamilius,</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;Prince of the Latian name.</span></p>

<h3>THE TROUBLE IN ROME</h3>

<p><span class="i0">But by the yellow Tiber</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;Was tumult and affright:</span><br />
<span class="i0">From all the spacious champaign</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;To Rome men took their flight.</span><br />
<span class="i0">A mile around the city</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;The throng stopped up the ways;</span><br />
<span class="i0">A fearful sight it was to see</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;Through two long nights and days.</span></p>

<p><span class="i0">For aged folk on crutches,</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;And women great with child,</span><br />
<span class="i0">And mothers sobbing over babes</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;That clung to them and smiled,</span><br />
<span class="i0">And sick men borne in litters</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;High on the necks of slaves,</span><br />
<span class="i0">And troops of sun-burned husbandmen</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;With reaping-hooks and staves,</span></p>

<p><span class="i0">And droves of mules and asses</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;Laden with skins of wine,</span><br />
<span class="i0">And endless flocks of goats and sheep,</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;And endless herds of kine,</span><br />
<span class="i0">And endless trains of waggons</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;That creaked beneath the weight</span><br />
<span class="i0">Of corn-sacks and of household goods,</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;Choked every roaring gate.</span></p>

<p><a class="pagebreak" name="page184" id="page184" title="184"></a>
<span class="i0">Now from the rock Tarpeian</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;Could the wan burghers spy</span><br />
<span class="i0">The line of blazing villages</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;Red in the midnight sky.</span><br />
<span class="i0">The Fathers of the City,</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;They sat all night and day,</span><br />
<span class="i0">For every hour some horseman came</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;With tidings of dismay.</span></p>

<p><span class="i0">To eastward and to westward</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;Have spread the Tuscan bands;</span><br />
<span class="i0">Nor house, nor fence, nor dovecote</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;In Crustumerium stands.</span><br />
<span class="i0">Verbenna down to Ostia</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;Hath wasted all the plain;</span><br />
<span class="i0">Astur hath stormed Janiculum,</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;And the stout guards are slain.</span></p>

<p><span class="i0">I wis, in all the Senate</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;There was no heart so bold</span><br />
<span class="i0">But sore it ached, and fast it beat,</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;When that ill news was told.</span><br />
<span class="i0">Forthwith up rose the Consul,</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;Up rose the Fathers all;</span><br />
<span class="i0">In haste they girded up their gowns,</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;And hied them to the wall.</span></p>

<p><span class="i0">They held a council standing</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;Before the River-Gate;</span><br />
<span class="i0">Short time was there, ye well may guess,</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;For musing or debate.</span><br />
<a class="pagebreak" name="page185" id="page185" title="185"></a>
<span class="i0">Out spake the Consul roundly:</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;The bridge must straight go down;</span><br />
<span class="i0">For, since Janiculum is lost,</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;Nought else can save the town.&rsquo;</span></p>

<p><span class="i0">Just then a scout came flying,</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;All wild with haste and fear:</span><br />
<span class="i0">&lsquo;To arms! to arms! Sir Consul:</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;Lars Porsena is here.&rsquo;</span><br />
<span class="i0">On the low hills to westward</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;The Consul fixed his eye,</span><br />
<span class="i0">And saw the swarthy storm of dust</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;Rise fast along the sky.</span></p>

<p><span class="i0">And nearer fast and nearer</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;Doth the red whirlwind come;</span><br />
<span class="i0">And louder still and still more loud,</span><br />
<span class="i0">From underneath that rolling cloud</span><br />
<span class="i0">Is heard the trumpet's war-note proud,</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;The trampling, and the hum.</span><br />
<span class="i0">And plainly and more plainly</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;Now through the gloom appears,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Far to left and far to right,</span><br />
<span class="i0">In broken gleams of dark-blue light,</span><br />
<span class="i0">The long array of helmets bright,</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;The long array of spears.</span></p>

<p><span class="i0">And plainly and more plainly</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;Above that glimmering line</span><br />
<span class="i0">Now might ye see the banners</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;Of twelve fair cities shine;</span><br />
<a class="pagebreak" name="page186" id="page186" title="186"></a>
<span class="i0">But the banner of proud Clusium</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;Was highest of them all,</span><br />
<span class="i0">The terror of the Umbrian,</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;The terror of the Gaul.</span></p>

<p><span class="i0">And plainly and more plainly</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;Now might the burghers know,</span><br />
<span class="i0">By port and vest, by horse and crest,</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;Each warlike Lucumo.</span><br />
<span class="i0">There Cilnius of Arretium</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;On his fleet roan was seen;</span><br />
<span class="i0">And Astur of the fourfold shield,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Girt with the brand none else may wield,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Tolumnius with the belt of gold,</span><br />
<span class="i0">And dark Verbenna from the hold</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;By reedy Thrasymene.</span></p>

<p><span class="i0">Fast by the royal standard</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;O'erlooking all the war,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Lars Porsena of Clusium</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;Sate in his ivory car.</span><br />
<span class="i0">By the right wheel rode Mamilius,</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;Prince of the Latian name;</span><br />
<span class="i0">And by the left false Sextus,</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;That wrought the deed of shame.</span></p>

<p><span class="i0">But when the face of Sextus</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;Was seen among the foes,</span><br />
<span class="i0">A yell that rent the firmament</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;From all the town arose.</span><br />
<a class="pagebreak" name="page187" id="page187" title="187"></a>
<span class="i0">On the house-tops was no woman</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;But spat towards him, and hissed;</span><br />
<span class="i0">No child but screamed out curses,</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;And shook its little fist.</span></p>

<p><span class="i0">But the Consul's brow was sad,</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;And the Consul's speech was low,</span><br />
<span class="i0">And darkly looked he at the wall,</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;And darkly at the foe.</span><br />
<span class="i0">&lsquo;Their van will be upon us</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;Before the bridge goes down;</span><br />
<span class="i0">And if they once may win the bridge,</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;What hope to save the town?&rsquo;</span></p>

<p><span class="i0">Then out spake brave Horatius,</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;The Captain of the gate:</span><br />
<span class="i0">&lsquo;To every man upon this earth</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;Death cometh soon or late;</span><br />
<span class="i0">And how can man die better</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;Than facing fearful odds,</span><br />
<span class="i0">For the ashes of his fathers</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;And the temples of his Gods,</span></p>

<p><span class="i0">And for the tender mother</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;Who dandled him to rest,</span><br />
<span class="i0">And for the wife who nurses</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;His baby at her breast,</span><br />
<span class="i0">And for the holy maidens</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;Who feed the eternal flame,</span><br />
<span class="i0">To save them from false Sextus</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;That wrought the deed of shame?</span></p>

<p><a class="pagebreak" name="page188" id="page188" title="188"></a>
<span class="i0">Hew down the bridge, Sir Consul,</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;With all the speed ye may;</span><br />
<span class="i0">I, with two more to help me,</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;Will hold the foe in play.</span><br />
<span class="i0">In yon strait path a thousand</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;May well be stopped by three.</span><br />
<span class="i0">Now who will stand on either hand,</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;And keep the bridge with me?&rsquo;</span></p>

<p><span class="i0">Then out spake Spurius Lartius,</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;A Ramnian proud was he:</span><br />
<span class="i0">&lsquo;Lo, I will stand at thy right hand,</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;And keep the bridge with thee.&rsquo;</span><br />
<span class="i0">And out spake strong Heminius,</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;Of Titian blood was he:</span><br />
<span class="i0">&lsquo;I will abide on thy left side,</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;And keep the bridge with thee.&rsquo;</span></p>

<p><span class="i0">&lsquo;Horatius,&rsquo; quoth the Consul,</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;As thou sayest, so let it be.&rsquo;</span><br />
<span class="i0">And straight against that great array</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;Forth went the dauntless Three.</span><br />
<span class="i0">For Romans in Rome's quarrel</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;Spared neither land nor gold,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Nor son nor wife, nor limb nor life,</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;In the brave days of old.</span></p>

<p><span class="i0">Then none was for a party;</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;Then all were for the state;</span><br />
<span class="i0">Then the great man helped the poor,</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;And the poor man loved the great:</span><br />
<a class="pagebreak" name="page189" id="page189" title="189"></a>
<span class="i0">Then lands were fairly portioned;</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;Then spoils were fairly sold:</span><br />
<span class="i0">The Romans were like brothers</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;In the brave days of old.</span></p>

<p><span class="i0">Now Roman is to Roman</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;More hateful than a foe,</span><br />
<span class="i0">And the Tribunes beard the high,</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;And the Fathers grind the low.</span><br />
<span class="i0">As we wax hot in faction,</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;In battle we wax cold:</span><br />
<span class="i0">Wherefore men fight not as they fought</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;In the brave days of old.</span></p>

<h3>THE KEEPING OF THE BRIDGE</h3>

<p><span class="i0">Now while the Three were tightening</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;Their harness on their backs,</span><br />
<span class="i0">The Consul was the foremost man</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;To take in hand an axe:</span><br />
<span class="i0">And Fathers mixed with Commons</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;Seized hatchet, bar, and crow,</span><br />
<span class="i0">And smote upon the planks above,</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;And loosed the props below.</span></p>

<p><span class="i0">Meanwhile the Tuscan army,</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;Right glorious to behold,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Came flashing back the noonday light,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Rank behind rank, like surges bright</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;Of a broad sea of gold.</span><br />
<span class="i0">Four hundred trumpets sounded</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;A peal of warlike glee,</span><br />
<a class="pagebreak" name="page190" id="page190" title="190"></a>
<span class="i0">As that great host, with measured tread,</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;And spears advanced, and ensigns spread,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Rolled slowly towards the bridge's head,</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;Where stood the dauntless Three.</span></p>

<p><span class="i0">The Three stood calm and silent,</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;And looked upon the foes,</span><br />
<span class="i0">And a great shout of laughter</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;From all the vanguard rose:</span><br />
<span class="i0">And forth three chiefs came spurring</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;Before that deep array;</span><br />
<span class="i0">To earth they sprang, their swords they drew,</span><br />
<span class="i0">And lifted high their shields, and flew</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;To win the narrow way;</span></p>

<p><span class="i0">Aunus from green Tifernum,</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;Lord of the Hill of Vines;</span><br />
<span class="i0">And Seius, whose eight hundred slaves</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;Sicken in Ilva's mines;</span><br />
<span class="i0">And Picus, long to Clusium</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;Vassal in peace and war,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Who led to fight his Umbrian powers</span><br />
<span class="i0">From that grey crag where, girt with towers,</span><br />
<span class="i0">The fortress of Nequinum lowers</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;O'er the pale waves of Nar.</span></p>

<p><span class="i0">Stout Lartius hurled down Aunus</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;Into the stream beneath:</span><br />
<span class="i0">Herminius struck at Seius,</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;And clove him to the teeth:</span><br />
<a class="pagebreak" name="page191" id="page191" title="191"></a>
<span class="i0">At Picus brave Horatius</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;Darted one fiery thrust,</span><br />
<span class="i0">And the proud Umbrian's gilded arms</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;Clashed in the bloody dust.</span></p>

<p><span class="i0">Then Ocnus of Falerii</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;Rushed on the Roman Three;</span><br />
<span class="i0">And Lausulus of Urgo,</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;The rover of the sea;</span><br />
<span class="i0">And Aruns of Volsinium,</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;Who slew the great wild boar,</span><br />
<span class="i0">The great wild boar that had his den</span><br />
<span class="i0">Amidst the reeds of Cosa's fen,</span><br />
<span class="i0">And wasted fields, and slaughtered men,</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;Along Albinia's shore.</span></p>

<p><span class="i0">Herminius smote down Aruns:</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;Lartius laid Ocnus low:</span><br />
<span class="i0">Right to the heart of Lausulus</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;Horatius sent a blow.</span><br />
<span class="i0">&lsquo;Lie there,&rsquo; he cried, &lsquo;fell pirate!</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;No more, aghast and pale,</span><br />
<span class="i0">From Ostia's walls the crowd shall mark</span><br />
<span class="i0">The track of thy destroying bark.</span><br />
<span class="i0">No more Campania's hinds shall fly</span><br />
<span class="i0">To woods and caverns when they spy</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;Thy thrice-accursed sail.&rsquo;</span></p>

<p><span class="i0">But now no sound of laughter</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;Was heard amongst the foes.</span><br />
<span class="i0">A wild and wrathful clamour</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;From all the vanguard rose.</span><br />
<a class="pagebreak" name="page192" id="page192" title="192"></a>
<span class="i0">Six spears' lengths from the entrance</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;Halted that deep array,</span><br />
<span class="i0">And for a space no man came forth</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;To win the narrow way.</span></p>

<p><span class="i0">But hark! the cry is Astur:</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;And lo! the ranks divide;</span><br />
<span class="i0">And the great Lord of Luna</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;Comes with his stately stride.</span><br />
<span class="i0">Upon his ample shoulders</span><br />
<span title="Original not indented" class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;Clangs loud the fourfold shield,</span><br />
<span class="i0">And in his hand he shakes the brand</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;Which none but he can wield.</span></p>

<p><span class="i0">He smiled on those bold Romans</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;A smile serene and high;</span><br />
<span class="i0">He eyed the flinching Tuscans,</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;And scorn was in his eye.</span><br />
<span class="i0">Quoth he, &lsquo;The she-wolf's litter</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;Stands savagely at bay:</span><br />
<span class="i0">But will ye dare to follow,</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;If Astur clears the way?&rsquo;</span></p>

<p><span class="i0">Then, whirling up his broadsword</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;With both hands to the height,</span><br />
<span class="i0">He rushed against Horatius,</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;And smote with all his might.</span><br />
<span class="i0">With shield and blade Horatius</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;Right deftly turned the blow.</span><br />
<span class="i0">The blow, though turned, came yet too nigh;</span><br />
<span title="Original indented" class="i0">It missed his helm, but gashed his thigh:</span><br />
<span class="i0">The Tuscans raised a joyful cry</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;To see the red blood flow.</span></p>

<p><a class="pagebreak" name="page193" id="page193" title="193"></a>
<span class="i0">He reeled, and on Herminius</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;He leaned one breathing-space;</span><br />
<span class="i0">Then, like a wild cat mad with wounds,</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;Sprang right at Astur's face.</span><br />
<span class="i0">Through teeth, and skull, and helmet,</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;So fierce a thrust he sped</span><br />
<span class="i0">The good sword stood a handbreadth out</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;Behind the Tuscan's head.</span></p>

<p><span class="i0">And the great Lord of Luna</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;Fell at that deadly stroke,</span><br />
<span class="i0">As falls on Mount Alvernus</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;A thunder-smitten oak:</span><br />
<span class="i0">Far o'er the crashing forest</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;The giant arms lie spread;</span><br />
<span class="i0">And the pale augurs, muttering low,</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;Gaze on the blasted head.</span></p>

<p><span class="i0">On Astur's throat Horatius</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;Right firmly pressed his heel,</span><br />
<span class="i0">And thrice and four times tugged amain,</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;Ere he wrenched out the steel.</span><br />
<span class="i0">&lsquo;And see,&rsquo; he cried, &lsquo;the welcome,</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;Fair guests, that waits you here!</span><br />
<span class="i0">What noble Lucumo comes next</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;To taste our Roman cheer?&rsquo;</span></p>

<p><span class="i0">But at his haughty challenge</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;A sullen murmur ran,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Mingled of wrath and shame and dread,</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;Along that glittering van.</span><br />
<a class="pagebreak" name="page194" id="page194" title="194"></a>
<span class="i0">There lacked not men of prowess,</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor men of lordly race;</span><br />
<span class="i0">For all Etruria's noblest</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;Were round the fatal place.</span></p>

<p><span class="i0">But all Etruria's noblest</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;Felt their hearts sink to see</span><br />
<span class="i0">On the earth the bloody corpses,</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;In the path the dauntless Three:</span><br />
<span class="i0">And, from the ghastly entrance</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;Where those bold Romans stood,</span><br />
<span class="i0">All shrank, like boys who unaware,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Ranging the woods to start a hare,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Come to the mouth of the dark lair</span><br />
<span class="i0">Where, growling low, a fierce old bear</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;Lies amidst bones and blood.</span></p>

<p><span class="i0">Was none who would be foremost</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;To lead such dire attack;</span><br />
<span class="i0">But those behind cried &lsquo;Forward!&rsquo;</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;And those before cried &lsquo;Back!&rsquo;</span><br />
<span class="i0">And backward now and forward</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;Wavers the deep array;</span><br />
<span class="i0">And on the tossing sea of steel,</span><br />
<span title="Original indented" class="i0">To and fro the standards reel;</span><br />
<span class="i0">And the victorious trumpet-peal</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;Dies fitfully away.</span></p>

<p><span class="i0">Yet one man for one moment</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;Strode out before the crowd;</span><br />
<span class="i0">Well known was he to all the Three,</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;And they gave him greeting loud.</span><br />
<a class="pagebreak" name="page195" id="page195" title="195"></a>
<span class="i0">&lsquo;Now welcome, welcome, Sextus!</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;Now welcome to thy home!</span><br />
<span class="i0">Why dost thou stay, and turn away?</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;Here lies the road to Rome.&rsquo;</span></p>

<p><span class="i0">Thrice looked he at the city;</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;Thrice looked he at the dead;</span><br />
<span class="i0">And thrice came on in fury,</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;And thrice turned back in dread:</span><br />
<span class="i0">And, white with fear and hatred,</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;Scowled at the narrow way</span><br />
<span class="i0">Where, wallowing in a pool of blood,</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;The bravest Tuscans lay.</span></p>

<p><span class="i0">But meanwhile axe and lever</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;Have manfully been plied;</span><br />
<span class="i0">And now the bridge hangs tottering</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;Above the boiling tide.</span><br />
<span class="i0">&lsquo;Come back, come back, Horatius!&rsquo;</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;Loud cried the Fathers all.</span><br />
<span class="i0">&lsquo;Back, Lartius! back, Herminius!</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;Back, ere the ruin fall!&rsquo;</span></p>

<p><span class="i0">Back darted Spurius Lartius;</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;Herminius darted back:</span><br />
<span class="i0">And, as they passed, beneath their feet</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;They felt the timbers crack.</span><br />
<span class="i0">But, when they turned their faces,</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;And on the farther shore</span><br />
<span class="i0">Saw brave Horatius stand alone,</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;They would have crossed once more.</span></p>

<p><a class="pagebreak" name="page196" id="page196" title="196"></a>
<span class="i0">But with a crash like thunder</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;Fell every loosened beam,</span><br />
<span class="i0">And, like a dam, the mighty wreck</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;Lay right athwart the stream:</span><br />
<span class="i0">And a long shout of triumph</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;Rose from the walls of Rome,</span><br />
<span class="i0">As to the highest turret-tops</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;Was splashed the yellow foam.</span></p>

<p><span class="i0">And, like a horse unbroken</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;When first he feels the rein,</span><br />
<span class="i0">The furious river struggled hard,</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;And tossed his tawny mane;</span><br />
<span class="i0">And burst the curb, and bounded,</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;Rejoicing to be free;</span><br />
<span class="i0">And whirling down, in fierce career,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Battlement, and plank, and pier,</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;Rushed headlong to the sea.</span></p>

<h3>FATHER TIBER</h3>

<p><span class="i0">Alone stood brave Horatius,</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;But constant still in mind;</span><br />
<span class="i0">Thrice thirty thousand foes before,</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;And the broad flood behind.</span><br />
<span class="i0">&lsquo;Down with him!&rsquo; cried false Sextus,</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;With a smile on his pale face.</span><br />
<span class="i0">&lsquo;Now yield thee,&rsquo; cried Lars Porsena,</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;Now yield thee to our grace.&rsquo;</span></p>

<p><span class="i0">Round turned he, as not deigning</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;Those craven ranks to see;</span><br />
<a class="pagebreak" name="page197" id="page197" title="197"></a>
<span class="i0">Nought spake he to Lars Porsena,</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;To Sextus nought spake he;</span><br />
<span class="i0">But he saw on Palatinus</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;The white porch of his home;</span><br />
<span class="i0">And he spake to the noble river</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;That rolls by the towers of Rome.</span></p>

<p><span class="i0">&lsquo;O Tiber! father Tiber!</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;To whom the Romans pray,</span><br />
<span class="i0">A Roman's life, a Roman's arms,</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;Take thou in charge this day!&rsquo;</span><br />
<span class="i0">So he spake, and speaking sheathed</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;The good sword by his side,</span><br />
<span class="i0">And with his harness on his back</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;Plunged headlong in the tide.</span></p>

<p><span class="i0">No sound of joy or sorrow</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;Was heard from either bank;</span><br />
<span class="i0">But friends and foes in dumb surprise,</span><br />
<span class="i0">With parted lips and straining eyes,</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;Stood gazing where he sank;</span><br />
<span class="i0">And when above the surges</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;They saw his crest appear,</span><br />
<span class="i0">All Rome sent forth a rapturous cry,</span><br />
<span class="i0">And even the ranks of Tuscany</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;Could scarce forbear to cheer.</span></p>

<p><span class="i0">But fiercely ran the current,</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;Swollen high by months of rain:</span><br />
<span class="i0">And fast his blood was flowing;</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;And he was sore in pain,</span><br />
<a class="pagebreak" name="page198" id="page198" title="198"></a>
<span class="i0">And heavy with his armour,</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;And spent with changing blows:</span><br />
<span class="i0">And oft they thought him sinking,</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;But still again he rose.</span></p>

<p><span class="i0">Never, I ween, did swimmer,</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;In such an evil case,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Struggle through such a raging flood</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;Safe to the landing-place:</span><br />
<span class="i0">But his limbs were borne up bravely</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;By the brave heart within,</span><br />
<span class="i0">And our good father Tiber</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;Bare bravely up his chin.</span></p>

<p><span class="i0">&lsquo;Curse on him!&rsquo; quoth false Sextus;</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;Will not the villain drown?</span><br />
<span class="i0">But for this stay ere close of day</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;We should have sacked the town!&rsquo;</span><br />
<span class="i0">&lsquo;Heaven help him!&rsquo; quoth Lars Porsena,</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;And bring him safe to shore;</span><br />
<span class="i0">For such a gallant feat of arms</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;Was never seen before.&rsquo;</span></p>

<p><span class="i0">And now he feels the bottom;</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;Now on dry earth he stands;</span><br />
<span class="i0">Now round him throng the Fathers</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;To press his gory hands;</span><br />
<span class="i0">And now with shouts and clapping,</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;And noise of weeping loud,</span><br />
<span class="i0">He enters through the River-Gate,</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;Borne by the joyous crowd.</span></p>

<p><a class="pagebreak" name="page199" id="page199" title="199"></a>
<span class="i0">They gave him of the corn-land,</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;That was of public right,</span><br />
<span class="i0">As much as two strong oxen</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;Could plough from morn till night;</span><br />
<span class="i0">And they made a molten image,</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;And set it up on high,</span><br />
<span class="i0">And there it stands unto this day</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;To witness if I lie.</span></p>

<p><span class="i0">It stands in the Comitium</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;Plain for all folk to see;</span><br />
<span class="i0">Horatius in his harness,</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;Halting upon one knee:</span><br />
<span class="i0">And underneath is written,</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;In letters all of gold,</span><br />
<span class="i0">How valiantly he kept the bridge</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;In the brave days of old.</span></p>

<p><span class="i0">And still his name sounds stirring</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;Unto the men of Rome,</span><br />
<span class="i0">As the trumpet-blast that cries to them</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;To charge the Volscian home;</span><br />
<span class="i0">And wives still pray to Juno</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;For boys with hearts as bold</span><br />
<span class="i0">As his who kept the bridge so well</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;In the brave days of old.</span></p>

<p><span class="i0">And in the nights of winter,</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;When the cold north winds blow,</span><br />
<span class="i0">And the long howling of the wolves</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;Is heard amidst the snow;</span><br />
<a class="pagebreak" name="page200" id="page200" title="200"></a>
<span class="i0">When round the lonely cottage</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;Roars loud the tempest's din,</span><br />
<span class="i0">And the good logs of Algidus</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;Roar louder yet within;</span></p>

<p><span class="i0">When the oldest cask is opened,</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;And the largest lamp is lit;</span><br />
<span class="i0">When the chestnuts glow in the embers,</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;And the kid turns on the spit;</span><br />
<span class="i0">When young and old in circle</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;Around the firebrands close;</span><br />
<span class="i0">When the girls are weaving baskets,</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;And the lads are shaping bows;</span></p>

<p><span class="i0">When the goodman mends his armour</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;And trims his helmet's plume;</span><br />
<span class="i0">When the goodwife's shuttle merrily</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;Goes flashing through the loom;</span><br />
<span class="i0">With weeping and with laughter</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;Still is the story told,</span><br />
<span class="i0">How well Horatius kept the bridge</span><br />

<h2><small><a href="#note_lxxxiv">LXXXV</a></small><br />THE ARMADA</h2>

<p><span class="i0">Attend, all ye who list to hear our noble England's praise;</span><br />
<span class="i0">I tell of the thrice famous deeds she wrought in ancient days,</span><br />
<a class="pagebreak" name="page201" id="page201" title="201"></a>
<span class="i0">When that great fleet invincible against her bore in vain</span><br />
<span class="i0">The richest spoils of Mexico, the stoutest hearts of Spain.</span><br />
<span class="i0">It was about the lovely close of a warm summer day,</span><br />
<span class="i0">There came a gallant merchant-ship full sail to Plymouth Bay;</span><br />
<span class="i0">Her crew hath seen Castile's black fleet, beyond Aurigny's isle,</span><br />
<span class="i0">At earliest twilight, on the waves lie heaving many a mile.</span><br />
<span class="i0">At sunrise she escaped their van, by God's especial grace;</span><br />
<span class="i0">And the tall Pinta, till the noon, had held her close in chase.</span><br />
<span class="i0">Forthwith a guard at every gun was placed along the wall;</span><br />
<span class="i0">The beacon blazed upon the roof of Edgecumbe's lofty hall;</span><br />
<span class="i0">Many a light fishing-bark put out to pry along the coast,</span><br />
<span class="i0">And with loose rein and bloody spur rode inland many a post.</span><br />
<span class="i0">With his white hair unbonneted, the stout old sheriff comes;</span><br />
<span class="i0">Behind him march the halberdiers; before him sound the drums;</span><br />
<span class="i0">His yeomen round the market cross make clear an ample space;</span><br />
<span class="i0">For there behoves him to set up the standard of Her Grace.</span><br />
<a class="pagebreak" name="page202" id="page202" title="202"></a>
<span class="i0">And haughtily the trumpets peal, and gaily dance the bells,</span><br />
<span class="i0">As slow upon the labouring wind the royal blazon swells.</span><br />
<span class="i0">Look how the Lion of the sea lifts up his ancient crown,</span><br />
<span class="i0">And underneath his deadly paw treads the gay lilies down!</span><br />
<span class="i0">So stalked he when he turned to flight, on that famed Picard field,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Bohemia's plume, and Genoa's bow, and C&aelig;sar's eagle shield.</span><br />
<span class="i0">So glared he when at Agincourt in wrath he turned to bay,</span><br />
<span class="i0">And crushed and torn beneath his claws the princely hunters lay.</span><br />
<span class="i0">Ho! strike the flagstaff deep, Sir Knight: ho! scatter flowers, fair maids:</span><br />
<span class="i0">Ho! gunners, fire a loud salute; ho! gallants, draw your blades:</span><br />
<span class="i0">Thou sun, shine on her joyously: ye breezes, waft her wide;</span><br />
<span class="i0">Our glorious <strong>semper eadem</strong>, the banner of our pride.</span></p>

<p><span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;The freshening breeze of eve unfurled that banner's massy fold;</span><br />
<span class="i0">The parting gleam of sunshine kissed that haughty scroll of gold;</span><br />
<span class="i0">Night sank upon the dusky beach and on the purple sea,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Such night in England ne'er had been, nor e'er again shall be.</span><br />
<a class="pagebreak" name="page203" id="page203" title="203"></a>
<span class="i0">From Eddystone to Berwick bounds, from Lynn to Milford Bay,</span><br />
<span class="i0">That time of slumber was as bright and busy as the day;</span><br />
<span class="i0">For swift to east and swift to west the ghastly war-flame spread,</span><br />
<span class="i0">High on St. Michael's Mount it shone: it shone on Beachy Head.</span><br />
<span class="i0">Far on the deep the Spaniard saw, along each southern shire,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Cape beyond cape, in endless range, those twinkling points of fire.</span><br />
<span class="i0">The fisher left his skiff to rock on Tamar's glittering waves:</span><br />
<span class="i0">The rugged miners poured to war from Mendip's sunless caves!</span><br />
<span class="i0">O'er Longleat's towers, o'er Cranbourne's oaks, the fiery herald flew:</span><br />
<span class="i0">He roused the shepherds of Stonehenge, the rangers of Beaulieu.</span><br />
<span class="i0">Right sharp and quick the bells all night rang out from Bristol town,</span><br />
<span class="i0">And ere the day three hundred horse had met on Clifton down;</span><br />
<span class="i0">The sentinel on Whitehall gate looked forth into the night,</span><br />
<span class="i0">And saw o'erhanging Richmond Hill the streak of blood-red light:</span><br />
<span class="i0">Then bugle's note and cannon's roar the death-like silence broke,</span><br />
<span class="i0">And with one start, and with one cry, the royal city woke.</span><br />
<a class="pagebreak" name="page204" id="page204" title="204"></a>
<span class="i0">At once on all her stately gates arose the answering fires;</span><br />
<span class="i0">At once the wild alarum clashed from all her reeling spires;</span><br />
<span class="i0">From all the batteries of the Tower pealed loud the voice of fear;</span><br />
<span class="i0">And all the thousand masts of Thames sent back a louder cheer;</span><br />
<span class="i0">And from the furthest wards was heard the rush of hurrying feet,</span><br />
<span class="i0">And the broad streams of pikes and flags rushed down each roaring street;</span><br />
<span class="i0">And broader still became the blaze, and louder still the din,</span><br />
<span class="i0">As fast from every village round the horse came spurring in.</span><br />
<span class="i0">And eastward straight from wild Blackheath the warlike errand went,</span><br />
<span class="i0">And roused in many an ancient hall the gallant squires of Kent.</span><br />
<span class="i0">Southward from Surrey's pleasant hills flew those bright couriers forth;</span><br />
<span class="i0">High on bleak Hampstead's swarthy moor they started for the north;</span><br />
<span class="i0">And on, and on, without a pause, untired they bounded still:</span><br />
<span class="i0">All night from tower to tower they sprang; they sprang from hill to hill:</span><br />
<span class="i0">Till the proud Peak unfurled the flag o'er Darwin's rocky dales,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Till like volcanoes flared to heaven the stormy huts of Wales,</span><br />

<h2><small><a href="#note_lxxxix">LXXXIX</a></small><br />THE BUILDING OF THE SHIP</h2>

<h3>THE MODEL</h3>

<p><span class="i0">&lsquo;Build me straight, O worthy Master!</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;Staunch and strong, a goodly vessel,</span><br />
<span class="i0">That shall laugh at all disaster,</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;And with wave and whirlwind wrestle!&rsquo;</span></p>

<p><span class="i0">The merchant's word</span><br />
<span class="i0">Delighted the Master heard;</span><br />
<span class="i0">For his heart was in his work, and the heart</span><br />
<span class="i0">Giveth grace unto every Art.</span><br />
<span class="i0">A quiet smile played round his lips,</span><br />
<span class="i0">As the eddies and dimples of the tide</span><br />
<span class="i0">Play round the bows of ships,</span><br />
<span class="i0">That steadily at anchor ride.</span><br />
<a class="pagebreak" name="page209" id="page209" title="209"></a>
<span class="i0">And with a voice that was full of glee,</span><br />
<span class="i0">He answered, &lsquo;Ere long we will launch</span><br />
<span class="i0">A vessel as goodly, and strong, and staunch,</span><br />
<span class="i0">As ever weathered a wintry sea!&rsquo;</span></p>

<p><span class="i0">And first with nicest skill and art,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Perfect and finished in every part,</span><br />
<span class="i0">A little model the Master wrought,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Which should be to the larger plan</span><br />
<span class="i0">What the child is to the man,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Its counterpart in miniature;</span><br />
<span class="i0">That with a hand more swift and sure</span><br />
<span class="i0">The greater labour might be brought</span><br />
<span class="i0">To answer to his inward thought.</span><br />
<span class="i0">And as he laboured, his mind ran o'er</span><br />
<span class="i0">The various ships that were built of yore,</span><br />
<span class="i0">And above them all, and strangest of all,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Towered the Great Harry, crank and tall,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Whose picture was hanging on the wall,</span><br />
<span class="i0">With bows and stern raised high in air,</span><br />
<span class="i0">And balconies hanging here and there,</span><br />
<span class="i0">And signal lanterns and flags afloat,</span><br />
<span class="i0">And eight round towers, like those that frown</span><br />
<span class="i0">From some old castle, looking down</span><br />
<span class="i0">Upon the drawbridge and the moat.</span><br />
<span class="i0">And he said with a smile, &lsquo;Our ship, I wis,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Shall be of another form than this!&rsquo;</span></p>

<p><span class="i0">It was of another form, indeed;</span><br />
<span class="i0">Built for freight, and yet for speed,</span><br />
<span class="i0">A beautiful and gallant craft;</span><br />
<a class="pagebreak" name="page210" id="page210" title="210"></a>
<span class="i0">Broad in the beam, that the stress of the blast,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Pressing down upon sail and mast,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Might not the sharp bows overwhelm;</span><br />
<span class="i0">Broad in the beam, but sloping aft</span><br />
<span class="i0">With graceful curve and slow degrees,</span><br />
<span class="i0">That she might be docile to the helm,</span><br />
<span class="i0">And that the currents of parted seas,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Closing behind, with mighty force,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Might aid and not impede her course.</span></p>

<h3>THE BUILDERS</h3>

<p><span class="i0">In the ship-yard stood the Master,</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;With the model of the vessel,</span><br />
<span class="i0">That should laugh at all disaster,</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;And with wave and whirlwind wrestle!</span></p>

<p><span class="i0">Covering many a rood of ground,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Lay the timber piled around;</span><br />
<span class="i0">Timber of chestnut, and elm, and oak,</span><br />
<span class="i0">And scattered here and there, with these,</span><br />
<span class="i0">The knarred and crooked cedar knees;</span><br />
<span class="i0">Brought from regions far away,</span><br />
<span class="i0">From Pascagoula's sunny bay,</span><br />
<span class="i0">And the banks of the roaring Roanoke!</span><br />
<span class="i0">Ah! what a wondrous thing it is</span><br />
<span class="i0">To note how many wheels of toil</span><br />
<span class="i0">One thought, one word, can set in motion!</span><br />
<span class="i0">There's not a ship that sails the ocean,</span><br />
<span class="i0">But every climate, every soil,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Must bring its tribute, great or small,</span><br />
<span class="i0">And help to build the wooden wall!</span></p>

<p><a class="pagebreak" name="page211" id="page211" title="211"></a>
<span class="i0">The sun was rising o'er the sea,</span><br />
<span class="i0">And long the level shadows lay,</span><br />
<span class="i0">As if they, too, the beams would be</span><br />
<span class="i0">Of some great, airy argosy,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Framed and launched in a single day.</span><br />
<span class="i0">That silent architect, the sun,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Had hewn and laid them every one,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Ere the work of man was yet begun.</span><br />
<span class="i0">Beside the Master, when he spoke,</span><br />
<span class="i0">A youth, against an anchor leaning,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Listened to catch his slightest meaning.</span><br />
<span class="i0">Only the long waves, as they broke</span><br />
<span class="i0">In ripples on the pebbly beach,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Interrupted the old man's speech.</span></p>

<p><span class="i0">Beautiful they were, in sooth,</span><br />
<span class="i0">The old man and the fiery youth!</span><br />
<span class="i0">The old man, in whose busy brain</span><br />
<span class="i0">Many a ship that sailed the main</span><br />
<span class="i0">Was modelled o'er and o'er again;&mdash;</span><br />
<span class="i0">The fiery youth, who was to be</span><br />
<span class="i0">The heir of his dexterity,</span><br />
<span class="i0">The heir of his house, and his daughter's hand,</span><br />
<span class="i0">When he had built and launched from land</span><br />
<span class="i0">What the elder head had planned.</span></p>

<p><span class="i0">&lsquo;Thus,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;will we build this ship!</span><br />
<span class="i0">Lay square the blocks upon the slip,</span><br />
<span class="i0">And follow well this plan of mine.</span><br />
<span class="i0">Choose the timbers with greatest care;</span><br />
<span class="i0">Of all that is unsound beware;</span><br />
<a class="pagebreak" name="page212" id="page212" title="212"></a>
<span class="i0">For only what is sound and strong</span><br />
<span class="i0">To this vessel shall belong.</span><br />
<span class="i0">Cedar of Maine and Georgia pine</span><br />
<span class="i0">Here together shall combine.</span><br />
<span class="i0">A goodly frame, and a goodly fame,</span><br />
<span class="i0">And the <strong>Union</strong> be her name!</span><br />
<span class="i0">For the day that gives her to the sea</span><br />
<span class="i0">Shall give my daughter unto thee!&rsquo;</span></p>

<p><span class="i0">The Master's word</span><br />
<span class="i0">Enraptur&egrave;d the young man heard;</span><br />
<span class="i0">And as he turned his face aside,</span><br />
<span class="i0">With a look of joy and a thrill of pride,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Standing before</span><br />
<span class="i0">Her father's door,</span><br />
<span class="i0">He saw the form of his promised bride.</span><br />
<span class="i0">The sun shone on her golden hair,</span><br />
<span class="i0">And her cheek was glowing fresh and fair,</span><br />
<span class="i0">With the breath of morn and the soft sea air.</span><br />
<span class="i0">Like a beauteous barge was she,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Still at rest on the sandy beach,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Just beyond the billow's reach;</span><br />
<span class="i0">But he</span><br />
<span class="i0">Was the restless, seething, stormy sea!</span></p>

<p><span class="i0">Ah! how skilful grows the hand</span><br />
<span class="i0">That obeyeth Love's command!</span><br />
<span class="i0">It is the heart, and not the brain,</span><br />
<span class="i0">That to the highest doth attain,</span><br />
<span class="i0">And he who followeth Love's behest</span><br />
<span class="i0">Far exceedeth all the rest!</span><br />
<a class="pagebreak" name="page213" id="page213" title="213"></a>
<span class="i0">Thus with the rising of the sun</span><br />
<span class="i0">Was the noble task begun,</span><br />
<span class="i0">And soon throughout the ship-yard's bounds</span><br />
<span class="i0">Were heard the intermingled sounds</span><br />
<span class="i0">Of axes and of mallets, plied</span><br />
<span class="i0">With vigourous arms on every side;</span><br />
<span class="i0">Plied so deftly and so well,</span><br />
<span class="i0">That ere the shadows of evening fell,</span><br />
<span class="i0">The keel of oak for a noble ship,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Scarfed and bolted, straight and strong,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Was lying ready, and stretched along</span><br />
<span class="i0">The blocks, well placed upon the slip.</span><br />
<span class="i0">Happy, thrice happy, every one</span><br />
<span class="i0">Who sees his labour well begun,</span><br />
<span class="i0">And not perplexed and multiplied,</span><br />
<span class="i0">By idly waiting for time and tide!</span></p>

<p><span class="i0">And when the hot, long day was o'er,</span><br />
<span class="i0">The young man at the Master's door</span><br />
<span class="i0">Sat with the maiden calm and still.</span><br />
<span class="i0">And within the porch, a little more</span><br />
<span class="i0">Removed beyond the evening chill,</span><br />
<span class="i0">The father sat, and told them tales</span><br />
<span class="i0">Of wrecks in the great September gales,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Of pirates upon the Spanish Main,</span><br />
<span class="i0">And ships that never came back again;</span><br />
<span class="i0">The chance and change of a sailor's life,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Want and plenty, rest and strife,</span><br />
<span class="i0">His roving fancy, like the wind,</span><br />
<span class="i0">That nothing can stay and nothing can bind:</span><br />
<span class="i0">And the magic charm of foreign lands,</span><br />
<span class="i0">With shadows of palms and shining sands,</span><br />
<a class="pagebreak" name="page214" id="page214" title="214"></a>
<span class="i0">Where the tumbling surf,</span><br />
<span class="i0">O'er the coral reefs of Madagascar,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Washes the feet of the swarthy Lascar,</span><br />
<span class="i0">As he lies alone and asleep on the turf.</span></p>

<p><span class="i0">And the trembling maiden held her breath</span><br />
<span class="i0">At the tales of that awful, pitiless sea,</span><br />
<span class="i0">With all its terror and mystery,</span><br />
<span class="i0">The dim, dark sea, so like unto Death,</span><br />
<span class="i0">That divides and yet unites mankind!</span><br />
<span class="i0">And whenever the old man paused, a gleam</span><br />
<span class="i0">From the bowl of his pipe would awhile illume</span><br />
<span class="i0">The silent group in the twilight gloom,</span><br />
<span class="i0">And thoughtful faces, as in a dream;</span><br />
<span class="i0">And for a moment one might mark</span><br />
<span class="i0">What had been hidden by the dark,</span><br />
<span class="i0">That the head of the maiden lay at rest,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Tenderly, on the young man's breast!</span></p>

<h3>IN THE SHIP-YARD</h3>

<p><span class="i0">Day by day the vessel grew,</span><br />
<span class="i0">With timbers fashioned strong and true,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Stemson and keelson and sternson-knee,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Till, framed with perfect symmetry,</span><br />
<span class="i0">A skeleton ship rose up to view!</span><br />
<span class="i0">And round the bows and along the side</span><br />
<span class="i0">The heavy hammers and mallets plied,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Till after many a week, at length,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Wonderful for form and strength,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Sublime in its enormous bulk,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Loomed aloft the shadowy hulk!</span><br />
<a class="pagebreak" name="page215" id="page215" title="215"></a>
<span class="i0">And around it columns of smoke, upwreathing,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Rose from the boiling, bubbling, seething</span><br />
<span class="i0">Caldron that glowed,</span><br />
<span class="i0">And overflowed</span><br />
<span class="i0">With the black tar, heated for the sheathing.</span><br />
<span class="i0">And amid the clamours</span><br />
<span class="i0">Of clattering hammers,</span><br />
<span class="i0">He who listened heard now and then</span><br />
<span class="i0">The song of the Master and his men:&mdash;</span></p>

<p><span class="i0">&lsquo;Build me straight, O worthy Master,</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;Staunch and strong, a goodly vessel,</span><br />
<span class="i0">That shall laugh at all disaster,</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;And with wave and whirlwind wrestle!&rsquo;</span></p>

<p><span class="i0">With oaken brace and copper band,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Lay the rudder on the sand,</span><br />
<span class="i0">That, like a thought, should have control</span><br />
<span class="i0">Over the movement of the whole;</span><br />
<span class="i0">And near it the anchor, whose giant hand</span><br />
<span class="i0">Would reach down and grapple with the land,</span><br />
<span class="i0">And immovable and fast</span><br />
<span class="i0">Hold the great ship against the bellowing blast!</span><br />
<span class="i0">And at the bows an image stood,</span><br />
<span class="i0">By a cunning artist carved in wood,</span><br />
<span class="i0">With robes of white, that far behind</span><br />
<span class="i0">Seemed to be fluttering in the wind.</span><br />
<span class="i0">It was not shaped in a classic mould,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Not like a Nymph or Goddess of old,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Or Naiad rising from the water,</span><br />
<span class="i0">But modelled from the Master's daughter!</span><br />
<a class="pagebreak" name="page216" id="page216" title="216"></a>
<span class="i0">On many a dreary and misty night</span><br />
<span class="i0">'Twill be seen by the rays of the signal light,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Speeding along through the rain and the dark,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Like a ghost in its snow-white sark,</span><br />
<span class="i0">The pilot of some phantom bark,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Guiding the vessel in its flight</span><br />
<span class="i0">By a path none other knows aright,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Behold, at last,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Each tall and tapering mast</span><br />
<span class="i0">Is swung into its place;</span><br />
<span class="i0">Shrouds and stays</span><br />
<span class="i0">Holding it firm and fast!</span></p>

<p><span class="i0">Long ago,</span><br />
<span class="i0">In the deer-haunted forests of Maine,</span><br />
<span class="i0">When upon mountain and plain</span><br />
<span class="i0">Lay the snow,</span><br />
<span class="i0">They fell&mdash;those lordly pines!</span><br />
<span class="i0">Those grand, majestic pines!</span><br />
<span class="i0">'Mid shouts and cheers</span><br />
<span class="i0">The jaded steers,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Panting beneath the goad,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Dragged down the weary, winding road</span><br />
<span class="i0">Those captive kings so straight and tall,</span><br />
<span class="i0">To be shorn of their streaming hair</span><br />
<span class="i0">And, naked and bare,</span><br />
<span class="i0">To feel the stress and the strain</span><br />
<span class="i0">Of the wind and the reeling main,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Whose roar</span><br />
<span class="i0">Would remind them for evermore</span><br />
<span class="i0">Of their native forest they should not see again.</span><br />
<a class="pagebreak" name="page217" id="page217" title="217"></a>
<span class="i0">And everywhere</span><br />
<span class="i0">The slender, graceful spars</span><br />
<span class="i0">Poise aloft in the air,</span><br />
<span class="i0">And at the mast head,</span><br />
<span class="i0">White, blue, and red,</span><br />
<span class="i0">A flag unrolls the stripes and stars,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Ah! when the wanderer, lonely, friendless,</span><br />
<span class="i0">In foreign harbours shall behold</span><br />
<span class="i0">That flag unrolled,</span><br />
<span class="i0">'Twill be as a friendly hand</span><br />
<span class="i0">Stretched out from his native land,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Filling his heart with memories sweet and endless.</span></p>

<h3>THE TWO BRIDALS</h3>

<p><span class="i0">All is finished! and at length</span><br />
<span class="i0">Has come the bridal day</span><br />
<span class="i0">Of beauty and of strength.</span><br />
<span class="i0">To-day the vessel shall be launched!</span><br />
<span class="i0">With fleecy clouds the sky is blanched,</span><br />
<span class="i0">And o'er the bay,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Slowly, in all his splendours dight,</span><br />
<span class="i0">The great sun rises to behold the sight.</span><br />
<span class="i0">The ocean old,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Centuries old,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Strong as youth, and as uncontrolled,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Paces restless to and fro</span><br />
<span class="i0">Up and down the sands of gold.</span><br />
<span class="i0">His beating heart is not at rest;</span><br />
<span class="i0">And far and wide,</span><br />
<a class="pagebreak" name="page218" id="page218" title="218"></a>
<span class="i0">With ceaseless flow,</span><br />
<span class="i0">His beard of snow</span><br />
<span class="i0">Heaves with the heaving of his breast.</span></p>

<p><span class="i0">He waits impatient for his bride.</span><br />
<span class="i0">There she stands,</span><br />
<span class="i0">With her foot upon the sands,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Decked with flags and streamers gay</span><br />
<span class="i0">In honour of her marriage day,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Her snow-white signals fluttering, blending,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Round her like a veil descending,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Ready to be</span><br />
<span class="i0">The bride of the grey, old sea.</span></p>

<p><span class="i0">On the deck another bride</span><br />
<span class="i0">Is standing by her lover's side.</span><br />
<span class="i0">Shadows from the flags and shrouds,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Like the shadows cast by clouds,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Broken by many a sunny fleck,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Fall around them on the deck.</span></p>

<p><span class="i0">The prayer is said,</span><br />
<span class="i0">The service read,</span><br />
<span class="i0">The joyous bridegroom bows his head,</span><br />
<span class="i0">And in tears the good old Master</span><br />
<span class="i0">Shakes the brown hand of his son,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Kisses his daughter's glowing cheek</span><br />
<span class="i0">In silence, for he cannot speak,</span><br />
<span class="i0">And ever faster</span><br />
<span class="i0">Down his own the tears begin to run.</span><br />
<span class="i0">The worthy pastor&mdash;</span><br />
<span class="i0">The shepherd of that wandering flock,</span><br />
<a class="pagebreak" name="page219" id="page219" title="219"></a>
<span class="i0">That has the ocean for its wold,</span><br />
<span class="i0">That has the vessel for its fold,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Leaping ever from rock to rock&mdash;</span><br />
<span class="i0">Spake, with accents mild and clear,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Words of warning, words of cheer,</span><br />
<span class="i0">But tedious to the bridegroom's ear.</span><br />
<span class="i0">He knew the chart,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Of the sailor's heart,</span><br />
<span class="i0">All its pleasures and its griefs,</span><br />
<span class="i0">All its shallows and rocky reefs,</span><br />
<span class="i0">All those secret currents that flow</span><br />
<span class="i0">With such resistless undertow,</span><br />
<span class="i0">And lift and drift with terrible force,</span><br />
<span class="i0">The will from its moorings and its course.</span><br />
<span class="i0">Therefore he spake, and thus said he:</span></p>

<p><span class="i0">&lsquo;Like unto ships far off at sea,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Outward or homeward bound, are we.</span><br />
<span class="i0">Before, behind, and all around,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Floats and swings the horizon's bound,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Seems at its distant rim to rise</span><br />
<span class="i0">And climb the crystal wall of the skies,</span><br />
<span class="i0">And then again to turn and sink,</span><br />
<span class="i0">As if we could slide from its outer brink.</span><br />
<span class="i0">Ah! it is not the sea,</span><br />
<span class="i0">It is not the sea that sinks and shelves,</span><br />
<span class="i0">But ourselves</span><br />
<span class="i0">That rock and rise</span><br />
<span class="i0">With endless and uneasy motion,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Now touching the very skies,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Now sinking into the depths of ocean.</span><br />
<a class="pagebreak" name="page220" id="page220" title="220"></a>
<span class="i0">Ah! if our souls but poise and swing</span><br />
<span class="i0">Like the compass in its brazen ring,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Ever level, and ever true</span><br />
<span class="i0">To the toil and the task we have to do,</span><br />
<span class="i0">We shall sail securely, and safely reach</span><br />
<span class="i0">The Fortunate Isles, on whose shining beach</span><br />
<span class="i0">The sights we see, and the sounds we hear,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Will be those of joy and not of fear!&rsquo;</span></p>

<p><span class="i0">Then the Master,</span><br />
<span class="i0">With a gesture of command,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Waved his hand;</span><br />
<span class="i0">And at the word,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Loud and sudden there was heard,</span><br />
<span class="i0">All around them and below,</span><br />
<span class="i0">The sound of hammers, blow on blow,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Knocking away the shores and spurs.</span><br />
<span class="i0">And see! she stirs!</span><br />
<span class="i0">She starts&mdash;she moves&mdash;she seems to feel</span><br />
<span class="i0">The thrill of life along her keel,</span><br />
<span class="i0">And, spurning with her foot the ground,</span><br />
<span class="i0">With one exulting, joyous bound,</span><br />
<span class="i0">She leaps into the ocean's arms!</span><br />
<span class="i0">And lo! from the assembled crowd</span><br />
<span class="i0">There rose a shout, prolonged and loud,</span><br />
<span class="i0">That to the ocean seemed to say,&mdash;</span><br />
<span class="i0">&lsquo;Take her, O bridegroom, old and grey,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Take her to thy protecting arms,</span><br />
<span class="i0">With all her youth and all her charms!&rsquo;</span></p>

<p><span class="i0">How beautiful she is! How fair</span><br />
<span class="i0">She lies within those arms, that press</span><br />
<a class="pagebreak" name="page221" id="page221" title="221"></a>
<span class="i0">Her form with many a soft caress</span><br />
<span class="i0">Of tenderness and watchful care!</span><br />

<span class="i0">Through wind and wave, right onward steer!</span><br />
<span class="i0">The moistened eye, the trembling lip,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Are not the signs of doubt or fear.</span></p>

<span class="i0">O gentle, loving, trusting wife,</span><br />
<span class="i0">And safe from all adversity</span><br />
<span class="i0">Upon the bosom of that sea</span><br />
<span class="i0">Thy comings and thy goings be!</span><br />
<span class="i0">For gentleness and love and trust</span><br />
<span class="i0">Prevail o'er angry wave and gust;</span><br />
<span class="i0">And in the wreck of noble lives</span><br />
<span class="i0">Something immortal still survives!</span></p>

<span class="i0">Humanity with all its fears,</span><br />
<span class="i0">With all the hopes of future years,</span><br />

<span class="i0">Fear not each sudden sound and shock,</span><br />

<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;Who dwelt in Helgoland,</span><br />
<span class="i0">To King Alfred, the Lover of Truth,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Brought a snow-white walrus-tooth,</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;Which he held in his brown right hand.</span></p>

<p><span class="i0">His figure was tall and stately,</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;Like a boy's his eye appeared;</span><br />
<span class="i0">His hair was yellow as hay,</span><br />
<span class="i0">But threads of a silvery grey</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;Gleamed in his tawny beard.</span></p>

<p><span class="i0">Hearty and hale was Othere,</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;His cheek had the colour of oak;</span><br />
<span class="i0">With a kind of laugh in his speech,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Like the sea-tide on a beach,</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;As unto the king he spoke.</span></p>

<p><span class="i0">And Alfred, King of the Saxons,</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;Had a book upon his knees,</span><br />
<span class="i0">And wrote down the wondrous tale</span><br />
<span class="i0">Of him who was first to sail</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;Into the Arctic seas.</span></p>

<p><span class="i0">&lsquo;So far I live to the northward,</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;No man lives north of me;</span><br />
<span class="i0">To the east are wild mountain-chains,</span><br />
<span class="i0">And beyond them meres and plains;</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;To the westward all is sea.</span></p>

<p><a class="pagebreak" name="page224" id="page224" title="224"></a>
<span class="i0">So far I live to the northward,</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;From the harbour of Skeringes-hale,</span><br />
<span class="i0">If you only sailed by day</span><br />
<span class="i0">With a fair wind all the way,</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;More than a month would you sail.</span></p>

<p><span class="i0">I own six hundred reindeer,</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;With sheep and swine beside;</span><br />
<span class="i0">I have tribute from the Finns,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Whalebone and reindeer-skins,</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;And ropes of walrus-hide.</span></p>

<p><span class="i0">I ploughed the land with horses,</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;But my heart was ill at ease,</span><br />
<span class="i0">For the old seafaring men</span><br />
<span class="i0">Came to me now and then,</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;With their sagas of the seas;&mdash;</span></p>

<p><span class="i0">Of Iceland and of Greenland,</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;And the stormy Hebrides,</span><br />
<span class="i0">And the undiscovered deep;&mdash;</span><br />
<span class="i0">I could not eat nor sleep</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;For thinking of those seas.</span></p>

<p><span class="i0">To the northward stretched the desert,</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;How far I fain would know;</span><br />
<span class="i0">So at last I sallied forth,</span><br />
<span class="i0">And three days sailed due north,</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;As far as the whale-ships go.</span></p>

<p><span class="i0">To the west of me was the ocean,</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;To the right the desolate shore,</span><br />
<span class="i0">But I did not slacken sail</span><br />

<span class="i0">I saw the sullen blaze</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the red midnight sun.</span></p>

<p><span class="i0">And then uprose before me,</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon the water's edge,</span><br />
<span class="i0">The huge and haggard shape</span><br />
<span class="i0">Of that unknown North Cape,</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;Whose form is like a wedge.</span></p>

<p><span class="i0">The sea was rough and stormy,</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;The tempest howled and wailed,</span><br />
<span class="i0">And the sea-fog, like a ghost,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Haunted that dreary coast,</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;But onward still I sailed.</span></p>

<p><span class="i0">Four days I steered to eastward,</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;Four days without a night:</span><br />
<span class="i0">Round in a fiery ring</span><br />
<span class="i0">Went the great sun, O King,</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;With red and lurid light.&rsquo;</span></p>

<p><span class="i0">Here Alfred, King of the Saxons,</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;Ceased writing for a while;</span><br />
<span class="i0">And raised his eyes from his book,</span><br />
<span class="i0">With a strange and puzzled look,</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;And an incredulous smile.</span></p>

<p><span class="i0">But Othere, the old sea-captain,</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;He neither paused nor stirred,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Till the King listened, and then</span><br />
<span class="i0">Once more took up his pen,</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;And wrote down every word.</span></p>

<p><a class="pagebreak" name="page226" id="page226" title="226"></a>
<span class="i0">&lsquo;And now the land,&rsquo; said Othere,</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;Bent southward suddenly,</span><br />
<span class="i0">And I followed the curving shore,</span><br />
<span class="i0">And ever southward bore</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;Into a nameless sea.</span></p>

<p><span class="i0">And there we hunted the walrus,</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;The narwhale, and the seal;</span><br />
<span class="i0">Ha! 'twas a noble game!</span><br />
<span class="i0">And like the lightning's flame</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;Flew our harpoons of steel.</span></p>

<p><span class="i0">There were six of us all together,</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;Norsemen of Helgoland;</span><br />
<span class="i0">In two days and no more</span><br />
<span class="i0">We killed of them threescore,</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;And dragged them to the strand.&rsquo;</span></p>

<p><span class="i0">Here Alfred, the Truth-Teller,</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;Suddenly closed his book,</span><br />
<span class="i0">And lifted his blue eyes,</span><br />
<span class="i0">With doubt and strange surmise</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;Depicted in their look.</span></p>

<p><span class="i0">And Othere, the old sea-captain,</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;Stared at him wild and weird,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Then smiled till his shining teeth</span><br />
<span class="i0">Gleamed white from underneath</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;His tawny, quivering beard.</span></p>

<p><span class="i0">And to the King of the Saxons,</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;In witness of the truth,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Raising his noble head,</span><br />
<span class="i0">He stretched his brown hand, and said,</span><br />

<span class="i0">While they drink the red wine of Tarragon,</span><br />
<span class="i0">From the cellars of some Spanish Don</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;Or convent set on flame.</span></p>

<p><span class="i0">Restless at times, with heavy strides</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;He paces his parlour to and fro;</span><br />
<span class="i0">He is like a ship that at anchor rides,</span><br />
<span class="i0">And swings with the rising and falling tides,</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;And tugs at her anchor-tow.</span></p>

<p><span class="i0">Voices mysterious far and near,</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;Sound of the wind and sound of the sea,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Are calling and whispering in his ear,</span><br />
<span class="i0">&lsquo;Simon Danz! Why stayest thou here?</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;Come forth and follow me!&rsquo;</span></p>

<p><span class="i0">So he thinks he shall take to the sea again</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;For one more cruise with his buccaneers,</span><br />
<span class="i0">To singe the beard of the King of Spain,</span><br />

<p><span class="i0">In her attic window the staff she set,</span><br />
<span class="i0">To show that one heart was loyal yet.</span></p>

<h2><small><a href="#note_xciv">XCIV</a></small><br />A BALLAD OF THE FLEET</h2>

<p><span class="i0">At Flores in the Azores Sir Richard Grenville lay,</span><br />
<span class="i0">And a pinnace, like a fluttered bird, came flying from far away:</span><br />
<a class="pagebreak" name="page233" id="page233" title="233"></a>
<span class="i0">&lsquo;Spanish ships of war at sea! we have sighted fifty-three!&rsquo;</span><br />
<span class="i0">Then sware Lord Thomas Howard: &lsquo;'Fore God I am no coward;</span><br />
<span class="i0">But I cannot meet them here, for my ships are out of gear,</span><br />
<span class="i0">And the half my men are sick. I must fly, but follow quick.</span><br />
<span class="i0">We are six ships of the line; can we fight with fifty-three?&rsquo;</span></p>

<p><span class="i0">Then spake Sir Richard Grenville: &lsquo;I know you are no coward;</span><br />
<span class="i0">You fly them for a moment to fight with them again.</span><br />
<span class="i0">But I've ninety men and more that are lying sick ashore.</span><br />
<span class="i0">I should count myself the coward if I left them, my Lord Howard,</span><br />
<span class="i0">To these Inquisition dogs and the devildoms of Spain.&rsquo;</span></p>

<p><span class="i0">So Lord Howard passed away with five ships of war that day,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Till he melted like a cloud in the silent summer heaven;</span><br />
<span class="i0">But Sir Richard bore in hand all the sick men from the land</span><br />
<span class="i0">Very carefully and slow,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Men of Bideford in Devon,</span><br />
<span class="i0">And we laid them on the ballast down below;</span><br />
<span class="i0">For we brought them all aboard,</span><br />
<a class="pagebreak" name="page234" id="page234" title="234"></a>
<span class="i0">And they blest him in their pain, that they were not left to Spain,</span><br />
<span class="i0">To the thumbscrew and the stake, for the glory of the Lord.</span></p>

<p><span class="i0">He had only a hundred seamen to work the ship and to fight,</span><br />
<span class="i0">And he sailed away from Flores till the Spaniard came in sight,</span><br />
<span class="i0">With his huge sea-castles heaving upon the weather bow.</span><br />
<span class="i0">&lsquo;Shall we fight or shall we fly?</span><br />
<span class="i0">Good Sir Richard, tell us now,</span><br />
<span class="i0">For to fight is but to die!</span><br />
<span class="i0">There'll be little of us left by the time this sun be set.&rsquo;</span><br />
<span class="i0">And Sir Richard said again: &lsquo;We be all good English men.</span><br />
<span class="i0">Let us bang those dogs of Seville, the children of the devil,</span><br />
<span class="i0">For I never turned my back upon Don or devil yet.&rsquo;</span></p>

<p><span class="i0">Sir Richard spoke and he laughed, and we roared a hurrah, and so</span><br />
<span class="i0">The little Revenge ran on sheer into the heart of the foe,</span><br />
<span class="i0">With her hundred fighters on deck, and her ninety sick below;</span><br />
<span class="i0">For half their fleet to the right and half to the left were seen,</span><br />
<span class="i0">And the little Revenge ran on through the long sea-lane between.</span></p>

<p><a class="pagebreak" name="page235" id="page235" title="235"></a>
<span class="i0">Thousands of their soldiers looked down from their decks and laughed,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Thousands of their seamen made mock at the mad little craft</span><br />
<span class="i0">Running on and on, till delayed</span><br />
<span class="i0">By their mountain-like San Philip that, of fifteen hundred tons,</span><br />
<span class="i0">And up-shadowing high above us with her yawning tiers of guns,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Took the breath from our sails, and we stayed.</span></p>

<p><span class="i0">And while now the great San Philip hung above us like a cloud</span><br />
<span class="i0">Whence the thunderbolt will fall</span><br />
<span class="i0">Long and loud,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Four galleons drew away</span><br />
<span class="i0">From the Spanish fleet that day,</span><br />
<span class="i0">And two upon the larboard and two upon the starboard lay,</span><br />
<span class="i0">And the battle thunder broke from them all.</span></p>

<p><span class="i0">But anon the great San Philip, she bethought herself and went,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Having that within her womb that had left her ill content;</span><br />
<span class="i0">And the rest they came aboard us, and they fought us hand to hand,</span><br />
<span class="i0">For a dozen times they came with their pikes and musqueteers,</span><br />
<span class="i0">And a dozen times we shook 'em off as a dog that shakes his ears</span><br />
<span class="i0">When he leaps from the water to the land.</span></p>

<p><a class="pagebreak" name="page236" id="page236" title="236"></a>
<span class="i0">And the sun went down, and the stars came out far over the summer sea,</span><br />
<span class="i0">But never a moment ceased the fight of the one and the fifty-three.</span><br />
<span class="i0">Ship after ship, the whole night long, their high-built galleons came,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Ship after ship, the whole night long, with her battle-thunder and flame;</span><br />
<span class="i0">Ship after ship, the whole night long, drew back with her dead and her shame.</span><br />
<span class="i0">For some were sunk and many were shattered, and so could fight us no more&mdash;</span><br />
<span class="i0">God of battles, was ever a battle like this in the world before?</span></p>

<p><span class="i0">For he said, &lsquo;Fight on! fight on!&rsquo;</span><br />
<span class="i0">Though his vessel was all but a wreck;</span><br />
<span class="i0">And it chanced that, when half of the short summer night was gone,</span><br />
<span class="i0">With a grisly wound to be drest he had left the deck,</span><br />
<span class="i0">But a bullet struck him that was dressing it suddenly dead,</span><br />
<span class="i0">And himself he was wounded again in the side and the head,</span><br />
<span class="i0">And he said, &lsquo;Fight on! fight on!&rsquo;</span></p>

<p><span class="i0">And the night went down and the sun smiled out far over the summer sea,</span><br />
<span class="i0">And the Spanish fleet with broken sides lay round us all in a ring;</span><br />
<span class="i0">But they dared not touch us again, for they feared that we still could sting,</span><br />
<a class="pagebreak" name="page237" id="page237" title="237"></a>
<span class="i0">So they watched what the end would be.</span><br />
<span class="i0">And we had not fought them in vain,</span><br />
<span class="i0">But in perilous plight were we,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Seeing forty of our poor hundred were slain,</span><br />
<span class="i0">And half of the rest of us maimed for life</span><br />
<span class="i0">In the crash of the cannonades and the desperate strife;</span><br />
<span class="i0">And the sick men down in the hold were most of them stark and cold,</span><br />
<span class="i0">And the pikes were all broken or bent, and the powder was all of it spent;</span><br />
<span class="i0">And the masts and the rigging were lying over the side;</span></p>

<p><span class="i0">But Sir Richard cried in his English pride:</span><br />
<span class="i0">&lsquo;We have fought such a fight for a day and a night</span><br />
<span class="i0">As may never be fought again!</span><br />
<span title="Original reads 'We have one great glory'" class="i0">We have won great glory, my men!</span><br />
<span class="i0">And a day less or more</span><br />
<span class="i0">At sea or ashore,</span><br />
<span class="i0">We die&mdash;does it matter when?</span><br />
<span class="i0">Sink me the ship, Master Gunner&mdash;sink her, split her in twain!</span><br />
<span class="i0">Fall into the hands of God, not into the hands of Spain!&rsquo;</span></p>

<p><span class="i0">And the gunner said, &lsquo;Ay, ay,&rsquo; but the seamen made reply:</span><br />
<span class="i0">&lsquo;We have children, we have wives,</span><br />
<span class="i0">And the Lord hath spared our lives.</span><br />
<span class="i0">We will make the Spaniard promise, if we yield, to let us go;</span><br />
<a class="pagebreak" name="page238" id="page238" title="238"></a>
<span class="i0">We shall live to fight again and to strike another blow.&rsquo;</span><br />
<span class="i0">And the lion there lay dying, and they yielded to the foe.</span></p>

<p><span class="i0">And the stately Spanish men to their flagship bore him then,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Where they laid him by the mast, old Sir Richard caught at last,</span><br />
<span class="i0">And they praised him to his face with their courtly foreign grace;</span><br />
<span class="i0">But he rose upon their decks, and he cried:</span><br />
<span class="i0">&lsquo;I have fought for Queen and Faith like a valiant man and true;</span><br />
<span class="i0">I have only done my duty as a man is bound to do:</span><br />
<span class="i0">With a joyful spirit I Sir Richard Grenville die!&rsquo;</span><br />
<span class="i0">And he fell upon their decks and he died.</span></p>

<p><span class="i0">And they stared at the dead that had been so valiant and true,</span><br />
<span class="i0">And had holden the power and glory of Spain so cheap</span><br />
<span class="i0">That he dared her with one little ship and his English few;</span><br />
<span class="i0">Was he devil or man? He was devil for aught they knew,</span><br />
<span class="i0">But they sank his body with honour down into the deep,</span><br />
<span class="i0">And they manned the Revenge with a swarthier alien crew,</span><br />
<span class="i0">And away she sailed with her loss and longed for her own;</span><br />
<a class="pagebreak" name="page239" id="page239" title="239"></a>
<span class="i0">When a wind from the lands they had ruined awoke from sleep,</span><br />
<span class="i0">And the water began to heave and the weather to moan,</span><br />
<span class="i0">And or ever that evening ended a great gale blew,</span><br />
<span class="i0">And a wave like the wave that is raised by an earthquake grew,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Till it smote on their hulls and their sails and their masts and their flags,</span><br />
<span class="i0">And the whole sea plunged and fell on the shot-shattered navy of Spain,</span><br />
<span class="i0">And the little Revenge herself went down by the island crags</span><br />
<span class="i0">To be lost evermore in the main.</span></p>

<span class="i4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A breastwork charged in vain;</span><br />
<span class="i3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eleven men of England</span><br />
<span class="i4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lie stripped, and gashed, and slain.</span><br />
<span class="i3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Slain; but of foes that guarded</span><br />
<span class="i4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their rock-built fortress well,</span><br />
<span class="i3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some twenty had been mastered,</span><br />
<span class="i4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the last soldier fell.</span></p>

<p><span class="i0">Whilst Napier piloted his wondrous way</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;Across the sand-waves of the desert sea,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Then flashed at once, on each fierce clan, dismay,</span><br />
<span class="i2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lord of their wild Truckee.</span><br />
<span class="i0">These missed the glen to which their steps were bent,</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;Mistook a mandate, from afar half heard,</span><br />
<span class="i0">And, in that glorious error, calmly went</span><br />
<span class="i2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To death without a word.</span></p>

<p><span class="i3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The robber-chief mused deeply</span><br />
<span class="i4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Above those daring dead;</span><br />
<span class="i3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;Bring here,&rsquo; at length he shouted,</span><br />
<span class="i4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;Bring quick, the battle thread.</span><br />
<span class="i3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let Eblis blast for ever</span><br />
<span class="i4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their souls, if Allah will:</span><br />
<span class="i3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But we must keep unbroken</span><br />
<span class="i4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old rules of the Hill.</span></p>

<p><span class="i3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before the Ghiznee tiger</span><br />
<span class="i4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leapt forth to burn and slay;</span><br />
<a class="pagebreak" name="page245" id="page245" title="245"></a>
<span class="i3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before the holy Prophet</span><br />
<span class="i4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Taught our grim tribes to pray;</span><br />
<span class="i3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before Secunder's lances</span><br />
<span class="i4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pierced through each Indian glen;</span><br />
<span class="i3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mountain laws of honour</span><br />
<span class="i4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Were framed for fearless men.</span></p>

<p><span class="i3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Still, when a chief dies bravely,</span><br />
<span class="i4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We bind with green <i>one</i> wrist&mdash;</span><br />
<span class="i3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Green for the brave, for heroes</span><br />
<span class="i4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>One</strong> crimson thread we twist.</span><br />
<span class="i3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Say ye, Oh gallant Hillmen,</span><br />
<span class="i4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For these, whose life has fled,</span><br />
<span class="i3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which is the fitting colour,</span><br />
<span class="i4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The green one or the red?&rsquo;</span></p>

<p><span class="i0">&lsquo;Our brethren, laid in honoured graves, may wear</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;Their green reward,&rsquo; each noble savage said;</span><br />
<span class="i0">&lsquo;To these, whom hawks and hungry wolves shall tear,</span><br />
<span class="i2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who dares deny the red?&rsquo;</span></p>

<p><span class="i0">Thus conquering hate, and steadfast to the right,</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;Fresh from the heart that haughty verdict came;</span><br />
<span class="i0">Beneath a waning moon, each spectral height</span><br />
<span class="i2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rolled back its loud acclaim.</span></p>

<p><span class="i3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once more the chief gazed keenly</span><br />
<span class="i4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Down on those daring dead;</span><br />
<span class="i3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From his good sword their heart's blood</span><br />
<span class="i4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Crept to that crimson thread.</span><br />
<span class="i3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once more he cried, &lsquo;The judgment,</span><br />
<span class="i4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Good friends, is wise and true,</span><br />
<a class="pagebreak" name="page246" id="page246" title="246"></a>
<span class="i3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But though the red <i>be</i> given,</span><br />
<span class="i4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Have we not more to do?</span></p>

<p><span class="i3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These were not stirred by anger,</span><br />
<span class="i4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor yet by lust made bold;</span><br />
<span class="i3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Renown they thought above them,</span><br />
<span class="i4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor did they look for gold.</span><br />
<span class="i3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To them their leader's signal</span><br />
<span class="i4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was as the voice of God:</span><br />
<span class="i3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unmoved, and uncomplaining,</span><br />
<span class="i4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The path it showed they trod.</span></p>

<p><span class="i3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As, without sound or struggle,</span><br />
<span class="i4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The stars unhurrying march,</span><br />
<span class="i3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where Allah's finger guides them,</span><br />
<span class="i4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through yonder purple arch,</span><br />
<span class="i3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These Franks, sublimely silent,</span><br />
<span class="i4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Without a quickened breath,</span><br />
<span class="i3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Went in the strength of duty</span><br />
<span class="i4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Straight to their goal of death.</span></p>

<p><span class="i3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;If I were now to ask you</span><br />
<span class="i4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To name our bravest man,</span><br />
<span class="i3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ye all at once would answer,</span><br />
<span class="i4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They called him Mehrab Khan.</span><br />
<span class="i3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He sleeps among his fathers,</span><br />
<span class="i4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dear to our native land,</span><br />
<span class="i3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the bright mark he bled for</span><br />
<span class="i4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firm round his faithful hand.</span></p>

<p><span class="i3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;The songs they sing of Rustum</span><br />
<span class="i4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fill all the past with light;</span><br />
<span class="i3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If truth be in their music,</span><br />
<span class="i4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was a noble knight.</span><br />
<a class="pagebreak" name="page247" id="page247" title="247"></a>
<span class="i3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But were those heroes living</span><br />
<span class="i4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And strong for battle still,</span><br />
<span title="Original reads 'Mehrad'" class="i3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Would Mehrab Khan or Rustum</span><br />
<span class="i4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Have climbed, like these, the hill?&rsquo;</span></p>

<p><span class="i0">And they replied, &lsquo;Though Mehrab Khan was brave,</span><br />
<span class="i2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As chief, he chose himself what risks to run;</span><br />
<span class="i0">Prince Rustum lied, his forfeit life to save,</span><br />
<span class="i3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which these had never done.&rsquo;</span></p>

<p><span class="i3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;Enough!&rsquo; he shouted fiercely;</span><br />
<span title="Opening quote missing in original" class="i4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;Doomed though they be to hell,</span><br />
<span class="i3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bind fast the crimson trophy</span><br />
<span class="i4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Round <strong>both</strong> wrists&mdash;bind it well.</span><br />
<span class="i3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who knows but that great Allah</span><br />
<span class="i4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May grudge such matchless men,</span><br />
<span class="i3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With none so decked in heaven,</span><br />
<span class="i4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the fiends' flaming den?&rsquo;</span></p>

<p><span class="i3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then all those gallant robbers</span><br />
<span class="i4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shouted a stern &lsquo;Amen!&rsquo;</span><br />
<span class="i3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They raised the slaughtered sergeant,</span><br />
<span class="i4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They raised his mangled ten.</span><br />
<span class="i3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And when we found their bodies</span><br />
<span class="i4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Left bleaching in the wind,</span><br />
<span class="i3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Around <strong>both</strong> wrists in glory</span><br />
<span class="i4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That crimson thread was twined.</span></p>

<p><span class="i0">Then Napier's knightly heart, touched to the core,</span><br />
<span class="i2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rung, like an echo, to that knightly deed,</span><br />
<span class="i0">He bade its memory live for evermore,</span><br />
<span class="i3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That those who run may read.</span></p>

<span class="i0">Sunset ran, one glorious blood-red, reeking into Cadiz Bay;</span><br />
<span class="i0">Bluish 'mid the burning water, full in face Trafalgar lay;</span><br />
<span class="i0">In the dimmest North-east distance dawned Gibraltar grand and grey;</span><br />
<span class="i0">&lsquo;Here and here did England help me: how can I help England?&rsquo;&mdash;say,</span><br />

<p class="poet"><i>Browning.</i></p>

<h2><small><a href="#note_xcviii">XCIX</a></small><br />HERV&Eacute; RIEL</h2>

<p><span class="i0">On the sea and at the Hogue, sixteen hundred ninety-two,</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;Did the English fight the French,&mdash;woe to France!</span><br />
<span class="i0">And, the thirty-first of May, helter-skelter thro' the blue,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Like a crowd of frightened porpoises a shoal of sharks pursue,</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;Came crowding ship on ship to St. Malo on the Rance,</span><br />
<span class="i0">With the English fleet in view.</span></p>

<p><a class="pagebreak" name="page249" id="page249" title="249"></a>
<span class="i0">'Twas the squadron that escaped, with the victor in full chase;</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;First and foremost of the drove, in his great ship, Damfreville;</span><br />
<span class="i2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Close on him fled, great and small,</span><br />
<span class="i2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Twenty-two good ships in all;</span><br />
<span class="i0">And they signalled to the place</span><br />
<span class="i0">&lsquo;Help the winners of a race!</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;Get us guidance, give us harbour, take us quick&mdash;or, quicker still,</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;Here's the English can and will!&rsquo;</span></p>

<p><span class="i0">Then the pilots of the place put out brisk and leapt on board;</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;Why, what hope or chance have ships like these to pass?&rsquo; laughed they:</span><br />
<span class="i0">&lsquo;Rocks to starboard, rocks to port, all the passage scarred and scored,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Shall the <i>Formidable</i> here with her twelve and eighty guns</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;Think to make the river-mouth by the single narrow way,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Trust to enter where 'tis ticklish for a craft of twenty tons,</span><br />
<span class="i2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And with flow at full beside?</span><br />
<span class="i2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, 'tis slackest ebb of tide.</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;Reach the mooring? Rather say,</span><br />
<span class="i0">While rock stands or water runs,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Not a ship will leave the bay!&rsquo;</span></p>

<p><span class="i0">Then was called a council straight.</span><br />
<span class="i0">Brief and bitter the debate:</span><br />
<a class="pagebreak" name="page250" id="page250" title="250"></a>
<span class="i0">&lsquo;Here's the English at our heels; would you have them take in tow</span><br />
<span class="i0">All that's left us of the fleet, linked together stern and bow,</span><br />
<span class="i0">For a prize to Plymouth Sound?</span><br />
<span class="i0">Better run the ships aground!&rsquo;</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;(Ended Damfreville his speech).</span><br />
<span class="i0">Not a minute more to wait!</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;Let the Captains all and each</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;Shove ashore, then blow up, burn the vessels on the beach!</span><br />
<span class="i0">France must undergo her fate.</span></p>

<p><span class="i0">Give the word!&rsquo; But no such word</span><br />
<span class="i0">Was ever spoke or heard;</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;For up stood, for out stepped, for in struck amid all these</span><br />
<span class="i0">&mdash;A Captain? A Lieutenant? A Mate&mdash;first, second, third?</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;No such man of mark, and meet</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;With his betters to compete!</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;But a simple Breton sailor pressed by Tourville for the fleet,</span><br />
<span class="i0">A poor coasting-pilot he, Herv&eacute; Riel the Croisickese.</span></p>

<p><span class="i0">And, &lsquo;What mockery or malice have we here?&rsquo; cries Herv&eacute; Riel:</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;Are you mad, you Malouins? Are you cowards, fools, or rogues?</span><br />
<span class="i0">Talk to me of rocks and shoals, me who took the soundings, tell</span><br />
<span class="i0">On my fingers every bank, every shallow, every swell</span><br />
<a class="pagebreak" name="page251" id="page251" title="251"></a>
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;'Twixt the offing here and Gr&egrave;ve where the river disembogues?</span><br />
<span class="i0">Are you bought by English gold? Is it love the lying's for?</span><br />
<span class="i2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Morn and eve, night and day,</span><br />
<span class="i2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Have I piloted your bay,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Entered free and anchored fast at the foot of Solidor.</span></p>

<p><span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;Burn the fleet and ruin France? That were worse than fifty Hogues!</span><br />
<span class="i2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sirs, they know I speak the truth! Sirs, believe me there's a way!</span><br />
<span class="i0">Only let me lead the line,</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;Have the biggest ship to steer,</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;Get this <i>Formidable</i> clear,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Make the others follow mine,</span><br />
<span class="i0">And I lead them, most and least, by a passage I know well,</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;Right to Solidor past Gr&egrave;ve,</span><br />
<span class="i2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And there lay them safe and sound;</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;And if one ship misbehave,</span><br />
<span class="i2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&mdash;Keel so much as grate the ground,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Why, I've nothing but my life,&mdash;here's my head!&rsquo; cries Herv&eacute; Riel.</span></p>

<p><span class="i0">Not a minute more to wait.</span><br />
<span class="i0">&lsquo;Steer us in, then, small and great!</span><br />
<span title="Closing quote missing in original" class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;Take the helm, lead the line, save the squadron!&rsquo; cried his chief.</span><br />

<a class="pagebreak" name="page252" id="page252" title="252"></a>
<span class="i0">Still the north-wind, by God's grace!</span><br />
<span class="i0">See the noble fellow's face,</span><br />
<span class="i0">As the big ship with a bound,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Clears the entry like a hound,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Keeps the passage as its inch of way were the wide seas profound!</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;See, safe thro' shoal and rock,</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;How they follow in a flock,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Not a ship that misbehaves, not a keel that grates the ground,</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;Not a spar that comes to grief!</span><br />
<span class="i0">The peril, see, is past,</span><br />
<span class="i0">All are harboured to the last,</span><br />
<span class="i0">And just as Herv&eacute; Riel hollas &lsquo;Anchor!&rsquo;&mdash;sure as fate</span><br />
<span class="i0">Up the English come, too late!</span></p>

<p><span class="i0">So, the storm subsides to calm:</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;They see the green trees wave</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;On the o'erlooking Gr&egrave;ve.</span><br />
<span class="i0">Hearts that bled are stanched with balm.</span><br />
<span class="i0">&lsquo;Just our rapture to enhance,</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;Let the English take the bay,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Gnash their teeth and glare askance,</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;As they cannonade away!</span><br />
<span class="i0">'Neath rampired Solidor pleasant riding on the Rance!&rsquo;</span><br />
<span class="i0">How hope succeeds despair on each Captain's countenance!</span><br />
<span class="i0">Out burst all with one accord,</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;This is Paradise for Hell!</span><br />
<a class="pagebreak" name="page253" id="page253" title="253"></a>
<span class="i2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let France, let France's King</span><br />
<span class="i2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thank the man that did the thing!&rsquo;</span><br />
<span class="i0">What a shout, and all one word,</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;Herv&eacute; Riel!&rsquo;</span><br />
<span class="i0">As he stepped in front once more,</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;Not a symptom of surprise</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;In the frank blue Breton eyes,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Just the same man as before.</span></p>

<p><span class="i0">Then said Damfreville, &lsquo;My friend,</span><br />
<span class="i0">I must speak out at the end,</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;Though I find the speaking hard.</span><br />
<span class="i0">Praise is deeper than the lips:</span><br />
<span class="i0">You have saved the King his ships,</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;You must name your own reward.</span><br />
<span class="i0">'Faith our sun was near eclipse!</span><br />
<span class="i0">Demand whate'er you will,</span><br />
<span class="i0">France remains your debtor still.</span><br />
<span class="i0">Ask to heart's content and have! or my name's not Damfreville.&rsquo;</span></p>

<p><span class="i0">Then a beam of fun outbroke</span><br />
<span class="i0">On the bearded mouth that spoke,</span><br />
<span class="i0">As the honest heart laughed through</span><br />
<span class="i0">Those frank eyes of Breton blue:</span><br />
<span class="i0">&lsquo;Since I needs must say my say,</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;Since on board the duty's done,</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;And from Malo Roads to Croisic Point, what is it but a run?&mdash;</span><br />
<span class="i0">Since 'tis ask and have, I may&mdash;</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the others go ashore&mdash;</span><br />
<span class="i0">Come! A good whole holiday!</span><br />
<a class="pagebreak" name="page254" id="page254" title="254"></a>
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;Leave to go and see my wife, whom I call the Belle Aurore!&rsquo;</span><br />
<span class="i0">That he asked and that he got,&mdash;nothing more.</span></p>

<p><span class="i0">Name and deed alike are lost:</span><br />
<span class="i0">Not a pillar nor a post</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;In his Croisic keeps alive the feat as it befell;</span><br />
<span class="i0">Not a head in white and black</span><br />
<span class="i0">On a single fishing smack,</span><br />
<span class="i0">In memory of the man but for whom had gone to wrack</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;All that France saved from the fight whence England bore the bell.</span><br />
<span class="i0">Go to Paris: rank on rank</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;Search the heroes flung pell-mell</span><br />
<span class="i0">On the Louvre, face and flank!</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;You shall look long enough ere you come to Herv&eacute; Riel.</span><br />
<span class="i0">So, for better and for worse,</span><br />

<p><span class="i0">Only three guns are in use,</span><br />
<span class="i0">One is directed by the captain himself against the enemy's main-mast,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Two well served with grape and canister silence his musketry and clear his decks.</span></p>

<p><span class="i0">The tops alone second the fire of this little battery, especially the main-top,</span><br />
<span class="i0">They hold out bravely during the whole of the action.</span></p>

<p><span class="i0">There were forty craft in Av&egrave;s that were both swift and stout,</span><br />
<span class="i0">All furnished well with small arms and cannons round about;</span><br />
<span class="i0">And a thousand men in Av&egrave;s made laws so fair and free</span><br />
<span class="i0">To choose their valiant captains and obey them loyally.</span></p>

<span class="i0">And I fled in a piragua, sore wounded, from the fight.</span></p>

<p><span class="i0">Nine days I floated starving, and a negro lass beside,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Till, for all I tried to cheer her, the poor young thing she died;</span><br />
<span class="i0">But as I lay a-gasping, a Bristol sail came by,</span><br />
<span class="i0">And brought me home to England here, to beg until I die.</span></p>

<p><span class="i0">And now I'm old and going&mdash;I'm sure I can't tell where;</span><br />

<p><span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;He spoke, and Sohrab kindled at his taunts,</span><br />
<span class="i0">And he too drew his sword; at once they rushed</span><br />
<span class="i0">Together, as two eagles on one prey</span><br />
<span class="i0">Come rushing down together from the clouds,</span><br />
<span class="i0">One from the east, one from the west; their shields</span><br />
<span class="i0">Dashed with a clang together, and a din</span><br />
<span class="i0">Rose, such as that the sinewy woodcutters</span><br />
<span class="i0">Make often in the forest's heart at morn,</span><br />
<a class="pagebreak" name="page268" id="page268" title="268"></a>
<span class="i0">Of hewing axes, crashing trees&mdash;such blows</span><br />
<span class="i0">Rustum and Sohrab on each other hailed.</span><br />
<span class="i0">And you would say that sun and stars took part</span><br />
<span class="i0">In that unnatural conflict; for a cloud</span><br />
<span class="i0">Grew suddenly in Heaven, and darkened the sun</span><br />
<span class="i0">Over the fighters' heads; and a wind rose</span><br />
<span class="i0">Under their feet, and moaning swept the plain,</span><br />
<span class="i0">And in a sandy whirlwind wrapped the pair.</span><br />
<span class="i0">In gloom they twain were wrapped, and they alone;</span><br />
<span class="i0">For both the on-looking hosts on either hand</span><br />
<span class="i0">Stood in broad daylight, and the sky was pure,</span><br />
<span class="i0">And the sun sparkled on the Oxus stream.</span><br />
<span class="i0">But in the gloom they fought, with bloodshot eyes</span><br />
<span class="i0">And labouring breath; first Rustum struck the shield</span><br />
<span class="i0">Which Sohrab held stiff out; the steel-spiked spear</span><br />
<span class="i0">Rent the tough plates, but failed to reach the skin,</span><br />
<span class="i0">And Rustum plucked it back with angry groan.</span><br />
<span class="i0">Then Sohrab with his sword smote Rustum's helm,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Nor clove its steel quite through; but all the crest</span><br />
<span class="i0">He shore away, and that proud horsehair plume,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Never till now defiled, sank to the dust;</span><br />
<span class="i0">And Rustum bowed his head; but then the gloom</span><br />
<span class="i0">Grew blacker, thunder rumbled in the air,</span><br />
<span class="i0">And lightnings rent the cloud; and Ruksh, the horse,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Who stood at hand, uttered a dreadful cry;&mdash;</span><br />
<span class="i0">No horse's cry was that, most like the roar</span><br />
<span class="i0">Of some pained desert-lion, who all day</span><br />
<span class="i0">Hath trailed the hunter's javelin in his side,</span><br />
<span class="i0">And comes at night to die upon the sand.</span><br />
<span class="i0">The two hosts heard that cry, and quaked for fear,</span><br />
<span class="i0">And Oxus curdled as it crossed his stream.</span><br />
<a class="pagebreak" name="page269" id="page269" title="269"></a>
<span class="i0">But Sohrab heard, and quailed not, but rushed on,</span><br />
<span class="i0">And struck again; and again Rustum bowed</span><br />
<span class="i0">His head; but this time all the blade, like glass,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Sprang in a thousand shivers on the helm,</span><br />
<span class="i0">And in the hand the hilt remained alone.</span><br />
<span class="i0">Then Rustum raised his head; his dreadful eyes</span><br />
<span class="i0">Glared, and he shook on high his menacing spear,</span><br />
<span class="i0">And shouted: <i>Rustum!</i>&mdash;Sohrab heard that shout,</span><br />
<span class="i0">And shrank amazed; back he recoiled one step,</span><br />
<span class="i0">And scanned with blinking eyes the advancing form;</span><br />
<span class="i0">And then he stood bewildered; and he dropped</span><br />
<span class="i0">His covering shield, and the spear pierced his side.</span><br />
<span class="i0">He reeled, and staggering back, sank to the ground;</span><br />
<span class="i0">And then the gloom dispersed, and the wind fell,</span><br />
<span class="i0">And the bright sun broke forth, and melted all</span><br />
<span class="i0">The cloud; and the two armies saw the pair&mdash;</span><br />
<span class="i0">Saw Rustum standing, safe upon his feet,</span><br />
<span class="i0">And Sohrab, wounded, on the bloody sand.</span></p>

<h3>SOHRAB</h3>

<p><span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;Then with a bitter smile, Rustum began:&mdash;</span><br />
<span class="i0">&lsquo;Sohrab, thou thoughtest in thy mind to kill</span><br />
<span class="i0">A Persian lord this day, and strip his corpse,</span><br />
<span class="i0">And bear thy trophies to Afrasiab's tent.</span><br />
<span class="i0">Or else that the great Rustum would come down</span><br />
<span class="i0">Himself to fight, and that thy wiles would move</span><br />
<span class="i0">His heart to take a gift, and let thee go.</span><br />
<span class="i0">And then that all the Tartar host would praise</span><br />
<span class="i0">Thy courage or thy craft, and spread thy fame,</span><br />
<span class="i0">To glad thy father in his weak old age.</span><br />
<a class="pagebreak" name="page270" id="page270" title="270"></a>
<span class="i0">Fool, thou art slain, and by an unknown man!</span><br />
<span class="i0">Dearer to the red jackels shalt thou be</span><br />
<span class="i0">Than to thy friends, and to thy father old,&rsquo;</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;And, with a fearless mien, Sohrab replied:&mdash;</span><br />
<span class="i0">&lsquo;Unknown thou art; yet thy fierce vaunt is vain.</span><br />
<span class="i0">Thou dost not slay me, proud and boastful man!</span><br />
<span class="i0">No! Rustum slays me, and this filial heart.</span><br />
<span class="i0">For were I matched with ten such men as thee,</span><br />
<span class="i0">And I were that which till to-day I was,</span><br />
<span class="i0">They should be lying here, I standing there.</span><br />
<span class="i0">But that beloved name unnerved my arm&mdash;</span><br />
<span class="i0">That name, and something, I confess, in thee,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Which troubles all my heart, and made my shield</span><br />
<span class="i0">Fall; and thy spear transfix an unarmed foe.</span><br />
<span class="i0">And now thou boastest, and insultest my fate.</span><br />
<span class="i0">But hear thou this, fierce man, tremble to hear:</span><br />
<span class="i0">The mighty Rustum shall avenge my death!</span><br />
<span class="i0">My father, whom I seek through all the world,</span><br />
<span class="i0">He shall avenge my death, and punish thee!&rsquo;</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;As when some hunter in the spring hath found</span><br />
<span class="i0">A breeding eagle sitting on her nest,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Upon the craggy isle of a hill-lake,</span><br />
<span class="i0">And pierced her with an arrow as she rose,</span><br />
<span class="i0">And followed her to find her where she fell</span><br />
<span class="i0">Far off;&mdash;anon her mate comes winging back</span><br />
<span class="i0">From hunting, and a great way off decries</span><br />
<span class="i0">His huddling young left-sole; at that he checks</span><br />
<span class="i0">His pinion, and with short uneasy sweeps</span><br />
<span class="i0">Circles above his eyry, with loud screams</span><br />
<span class="i0">Chiding his mate back to her nest; but she</span><br />
<span class="i0">Lies dying, with the arrow in her side,</span><br />
<a class="pagebreak" name="page271" id="page271" title="271"></a>
<span class="i0">In some far stony gorge out of his ken,</span><br />
<span class="i0">A heap of fluttering feathers&mdash;never more</span><br />
<span class="i0">Shall the lake glass her, flying over it;</span><br />
<span class="i0">Never the black and dripping precipices</span><br />
<span class="i0">Echo her stormy scream as she sails by&mdash;</span><br />
<span class="i0">As that poor bird flies home, nor knows his loss,</span><br />
<span class="i0">So Rustum knew not his own loss, but stood</span><br />
<span class="i0">Over his dying son, and knew him not.</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;But, with a cold, incredulous voice he said:</span><br />
<span class="i0">&lsquo;What prate is this of fathers and revenge?</span><br />
<span class="i0">The mighty Rustum never had a son.&rsquo;</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;And with a failing voice Sohrab replied:</span><br />
<span class="i0">&lsquo;Ah yes, he had! and that lost son am I,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Surely the news will one day reach his ear,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Reach Rustum, where he sits, and tarries long,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Somewhere, I know not where, but far from here;</span><br />
<span class="i0">And pierce him like a stab, and make him leap</span><br />
<span class="i0">To arms, and cry for vengeance upon thee.</span><br />
<span class="i0">Fierce man, bethink thee, for an only son!</span><br />
<span class="i0">What will that grief, what will that vengeance be?</span><br />
<span class="i0">O could I live, till I that grief had seen!</span><br />
<span class="i0">Yet him I pity not so much, but her,</span><br />
<span class="i0">My mother, who in Ader-baijan dwells</span><br />
<span class="i0">With that old king, her father, who grows grey</span><br />
<span class="i0">With age, and rules over the valiant Koords.</span><br />
<span class="i0">Her most I pity, who no more will see</span><br />
<span class="i0">Sohrab returning from the Tartar camp,</span><br />
<span class="i0">With spoils and honour, when the war is done.</span><br />
<span class="i0">But a dark rumour will be bruited up,</span><br />
<span class="i0">From tribe to tribe, until it reach her ear;</span><br />
<span class="i0">And then will that defenceless woman learn</span><br />
<a class="pagebreak" name="page272" id="page272" title="272"></a>
<span class="i0">That Sohrab will rejoice her sight no more,</span><br />
<span class="i0">But that in battle with a nameless foe,</span><br />
<span class="i0">By the far-distant Oxus, he is slain.&rsquo;</span></p>

<h3>THE RECOGNITION</h3>

<p><span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;He spoke, and as he ceased he wept aloud,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Thinking of her he left, and his own death.</span><br />
<span class="i0">He spoke; but Rustum listened plunged in thought.</span><br />
<span class="i0">Nor did he yet believe it was his son</span><br />
<span class="i0">Who spoke, although he called back names he knew;</span><br />
<span class="i0">For he had had sure tidings that the babe,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Which was in Ader-baijan born to him,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Had been a puny girl, no boy at all&mdash;</span><br />
<span class="i0">So that sad mother sent him word, for fear</span><br />
<span class="i0">Rustum should seek the boy, to train in arms.</span><br />
<span class="i0">And as he deemed that either Sohrab took,</span><br />
<span class="i0">By a false boast, the style of Rustum's son;</span><br />
<span class="i0">Or that men gave it him, to swell his fame.</span><br />
<span class="i0">So deemed he; yet he listened plunged in thought;</span><br />
<span class="i0">And his soul set to grief, as the vast tide</span><br />
<span class="i0">Of the bright rocking Ocean sets to shore</span><br />
<span class="i0">At the full moon; tears gathered in his eyes;</span><br />
<span class="i0">For he remembered his own early youth,</span><br />
<span class="i0">And all its bounding rapture; as, at dawn,</span><br />
<span class="i0">The shepherd from his mountain-lodge descries</span><br />
<span class="i0">A far, bright city, smitten by the sun,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Through many rolling clouds&mdash;so Rustum saw</span><br />
<span class="i0">His youth; saw Sohrab's mother, in her bloom;</span><br />
<span class="i0">And that old king, her father, who loved well</span><br />
<span class="i0">His wandering guest, and gave him his fair child</span><br />
<span class="i0">With joy; and all the pleasant life they led,</span><br />
<a class="pagebreak" name="page273" id="page273" title="273"></a>
<span class="i0">They three, in that long-distant summer-time&mdash;</span><br />
<span class="i0">The castle, and the dewy woods, and hunt</span><br />
<span class="i0">And hound, and morn on those delightful hills</span><br />
<span class="i0">In Ader-baijan. And he saw that Youth,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Of age and looks to be his own dear son,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Piteous and lovely, lying on the sand,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Like some rich hyacinth which by the scythe</span><br />
<span class="i0">Of an unskilful gardener has been cut,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Mowing the garden grass-plots near its bed,</span><br />
<span class="i0">And lies, a fragrant tower of purple bloom,</span><br />
<span class="i0">On the mown, dying grass&mdash;so Sohrab lay,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Lovely in death, upon the common sand.</span><br />
<span class="i0">And Rustum gazed on him in grief, and said:</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;O Sohrab, thou indeed art such a son</span><br />
<span class="i0">Whom Rustum, wert thou his, might well have loved:</span><br />
<span class="i0">Yet here thou errest, Sohrab, or else men</span><br />
<span class="i0">Have told thee false&mdash;thou art not Rustum's son.</span><br />
<span class="i0">For Rustum had no son; one child he had&mdash;</span><br />
<span class="i0">But one&mdash;a girl; who with her mother now</span><br />
<span class="i0">Plies some light female task, nor dreams of us&mdash;</span><br />
<span class="i0">Of us she dreams not, nor of wounds, nor war.&rsquo;</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;But Sohrab answered him in wrath; for now</span><br />
<span class="i0">The anguish of the deep-fixed spear grew fierce,</span><br />
<span class="i0">And he desir&egrave;d to draw forth the steel,</span><br />
<span class="i0">And let the blood flow free, and so to die&mdash;</span><br />
<span class="i0">But first he would convince his stubborn foe;</span><br />
<span class="i0">And, rising sternly on one arm, he said:</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;Man, who art thou who dost deny my words?</span><br />
<span class="i0">Truth sits upon the lips of dying men,</span><br />
<span class="i0">And falsehood, while I lived, was far from mine.</span><br />
<span class="i0">I tell thee, pricked upon this arm I bear</span><br />
<a class="pagebreak" name="page274" id="page274" title="274"></a>
<span class="i0">That seal which Rustum to my mother gave,</span><br />
<span class="i0">That she might prick it on the babe she bore.&rsquo;</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;He spoke; and all the blood left Rustum's cheeks,</span><br />
<span class="i0">And his knees tottered, and he smote his hand</span><br />
<span class="i0">Against his breast, his heavy mail&egrave;d hand,</span><br />
<span class="i0">That the hard iron corselet clanked aloud;</span><br />
<span class="i0">And to his heart he pressed the other hand,</span><br />
<span class="i0">And in a hollow voice he spake and said:</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;Sohrab, that were a proof that could not lie!</span><br />
<span class="i0">If thou show this, then art thou Rustum's son.&rsquo;</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;Then with weak hasty fingers Sohrab loosed</span><br />
<span class="i0">His belt, and near the shoulder bared his arm,</span><br />
<span class="i0">And showed a sign in faint vermilion points</span><br />
<span class="i0">Pricked; as a cunning workman, in Pekin,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Pricks with vermilion some clear porcelain vase,</span><br />
<span class="i0">An emperor's gift&mdash;at early morn he paints,</span><br />
<span class="i0">And all day long, and, when night comes, the lamp</span><br />
<span class="i0">Lights up his studious forehead and thin hands&mdash;</span><br />
<span class="i0">So delicately pricked the sign appeared</span><br />
<span class="i0">On Sohrab's arm, the sign of Rustum's seal.</span><br />
<span class="i0">It was that griffin, which of old reared Zal,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Rustum's great father, whom they left to die,</span><br />
<span class="i0">A helpless babe, among the mountain rocks;</span><br />
<span class="i0">Him that kind creature found, and reared, and loved&mdash;</span><br />
<span class="i0">Then Rustum took it for his glorious sign.</span><br />
<span class="i0">And Sohrab bared that image on his arm,</span><br />
<span class="i0">And himself scanned it long with mournful eyes,</span><br />
<span class="i0">And then he touched it with his hand and said:&mdash;</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;How sayest thou? Is that sign the proper sign</span><br />
<span class="i0">Of Rustum's son, or of some other man's?&rsquo;</span></p>

<h3><a class="pagebreak" name="page275" id="page275" title="275"></a>RUKSH THE HORSE</h3>

<p><span class="i0">He spoke; but Rustum gazed, and gazed, and stood</span><br />
<span class="i0">Speechless; and then he uttered one sharp cry:</span><br />
<span class="i0"><i>O boy&mdash;thy father!</i>&mdash;and his voice choked there.</span><br />
<span class="i0">And then a dark cloud passed before his eyes,</span><br />
<span class="i0">And his head swam, and he sank down to earth.</span><br />
<span class="i0">But Sohrab crawled to where he lay, and cast</span><br />
<span class="i0">His arms about his neck, and kissed his lips,</span><br />
<span class="i0">And with fond faltering fingers stroked his cheeks,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Trying to call him back to life; and life</span><br />
<span class="i0">Came back to Rustum, and he oped his eyes,</span><br />
<span class="i0">And they stood wide with horror; and he seized</span><br />
<span class="i0">In both his hands the dust which lay around,</span><br />
<span class="i0">And threw it on his head, and smirched his hair,&mdash;</span><br />
<span class="i0">His hair, and face, and beard, and glittering arms;</span><br />
<span class="i0">And strong convulsive groanings shook his breast,</span><br />
<span class="i0">And his sobs choked him; and he clutched his sword,</span><br />
<span class="i0">To draw it, and for ever let life out.</span><br />
<span class="i0">But Sohrab saw his thought, and held his hands,</span><br />
<span class="i0">And with a soothing voice he spake, and said:</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;Father, forbear! for I but meet to-day</span><br />
<span class="i0">The doom which at my birth was written down</span><br />
<span class="i0">In Heaven, and thou art Heaven's unconscious hand.</span><br />
<span class="i0">Surely my heart cried out that it was thou,</span><br />
<span class="i0">When first I saw thee; and thy heart spoke too,</span><br />
<span class="i0">I know it! but fate trod these promptings down</span><br />
<span class="i0">Under its iron heel; fate, fate engaged</span><br />
<span class="i0">The strife, and hurled me on my father's spear.</span><br />
<span class="i0">But let us speak no more of this! I find</span><br />
<span class="i0">My father; let me feel that I have found!</span><br />
<a class="pagebreak" name="page276" id="page276" title="276"></a>
<span class="i0">Come, sit beside me on this sand, and take</span><br />
<span class="i0">My head betwixt thy hands, and kiss my cheeks,</span><br />
<span class="i0">And wash them with thy tears, and say: <i>My son!</i></span><br />
<span class="i0">Quick! quick! for numbered are my sands of life,</span><br />
<span class="i0">And swift; for like the lightning to this field</span><br />
<span class="i0">I came, and like the wind I go away&mdash;</span><br />
<span class="i0">Sudden, and swift, and like a passing wind.</span><br />
<span class="i0">But it was writ in Heaven that this should be.&rsquo;</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;So said he, and his voice released the heart</span><br />
<span class="i0">Of Rustum and his tears broke forth; he cast</span><br />
<span class="i0">His arms round his son's neck, and wept aloud,</span><br />
<span class="i0">And kissed him. And awe fell on both the hosts,</span><br />
<span class="i0">When they saw Rustum's grief; and Ruksh the horse,</span><br />
<span class="i0">With his head bowing to the ground and mane</span><br />
<span class="i0">Sweeping the dust, came near, and in mute woe</span><br />
<span class="i0">First to the one, then to the other moved</span><br />
<span class="i0">His head, as if inquiring what their grief</span><br />
<span class="i0">Might mean; and from his dark, compassionate eyes,</span><br />
<span class="i0">The big warm tears rolled down, and caked the sand.</span><br />
<span class="i0">But Rustum chid him with stern voice, and said:&mdash;</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;Ruksh, now thou grievest; but, O Ruksh, thy feet</span><br />
<span class="i0">Should first have rotted on their nimble joints,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Or ere they brought thy master to this field!&rsquo;</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;But Sohrab looked upon the horse and said:</span><br />
<span class="i0">&lsquo;Is this, then, Ruksh? How often in past days,</span><br />
<span class="i0">My mother told me of thee, thou brave steed,</span><br />
<span class="i0">My terrible father's terrible horse! and said,</span><br />
<span class="i0">That I should one day find thy lord and thee.</span><br />
<span class="i0">Come, let me lay my hand upon thy mane!</span><br />
<span class="i0">O Ruksh, thou art more fortunate than I;</span><br />
<a class="pagebreak" name="page277" id="page277" title="277"></a>
<span class="i0">For thou hast gone where I shall never go,</span><br />
<span class="i0">And snuffed the breezes of my father's home.</span><br />
<span class="i0">And thou hast trod the sands of Seistan,</span><br />
<span class="i0">And seen the river of Helmund, and the Lake</span><br />
<span class="i0">Of Zirrah; and the aged Zal himself</span><br />
<span class="i0">Has often stroked thy neck, and given thee food,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Corn in a golden platter soaked with wine,</span><br />
<span class="i0">And said: <i>O Ruksh! bear Rustum well!</i>&mdash;but I</span><br />
<span class="i0">Have never known my grandsire's furrowed face,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Nor seen his lofty house in Seistan,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Nor slaked my thirst at the clear Helmund stream;</span><br />
<span class="i0">But lodged among my father's foes, and seen</span><br />
<span class="i0">Afrasiab's cities only, Samarcand,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Bokhara, and lone Khiva in the waste,</span><br />
<span class="i0">And the black Toorkman tents; and only drunk</span><br />
<span class="i0">The desert rivers, Moorghab and Tejend,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Kohik, and where the Kalmuks feed their sheep,</span><br />
<span class="i0">The northern Sir; and this great Oxus stream,</span><br />
<span class="i0">The yellow Oxus, by whose brink I die.&rsquo;</span></p>

<h3>RUSTUM</h3>

<p><span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;Then with a heavy groan, Rustum bewailed:</span><br />
<span class="i0">&lsquo;O that its waves were flowing over me!</span><br />
<span class="i0">O that I saw its grains of yellow silt</span><br />
<span class="i0">Roll tumbling in the current o'er my head!&rsquo;</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;But with a grave mild voice, Sohrab replied:&mdash;</span><br />
<span class="i0">&lsquo;Desire not that, my father! thou must live.</span><br />
<span class="i0">For some are born to do great deeds, and live,</span><br />
<span class="i0">As some are born to be obscured, and die.</span><br />
<span class="i0">Do thou the deeds I die too young to do,</span><br />
<a class="pagebreak" name="page278" id="page278" title="278"></a>
<span class="i0">And reap a second glory in thine age;</span><br />
<span class="i0">Thou art my father, and thy gain is mine.</span><br />
<span class="i0">But come! thou seest this great host of men</span><br />
<span class="i0">Which follow me; I pray thee, slay not these!</span><br />
<span class="i0">Let me entreat for them; what have they done?</span><br />
<span class="i0">They followed me, my hope, my fame, my star.</span><br />
<span class="i0">Let them all cross the Oxus back in peace.</span><br />
<span class="i0">But me thou must bear hence, not send with them,</span><br />
<span class="i0">But carry me with thee to Seistan,</span><br />
<span class="i0">And place me on a bed, and mourn for me,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Thou, and the snow-haired Zal, and all thy friends.</span><br />
<span class="i0">And thou must lay me in that lovely earth,</span><br />
<span class="i0">And heap a stately mound above my bones,</span><br />
<span class="i0">And plant a far-seen pillar over all.</span><br />
<span class="i0">That so the passing horseman on the waste</span><br />
<span class="i0">May see my tomb a great way off, and cry;</span><br />
<span class="i0"><i>Sohrab, the mighty Rustum's son, lies here,</i></span><br />
<span class="i0"><i>Whom his great father did in ignorance kill!</i></span><br />
<span class="i0">And I be not forgotten in my grave.&rsquo;</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;And, with a mournful voice, Rustum replied:</span><br />
<span class="i0">&lsquo;Fear not! as thou hast said, Sohrab, my son,</span><br />
<span class="i0">So shall it be; for I will burn my tents,</span><br />
<span class="i0">And quit the host, and bear thee hence with me,</span><br />
<span class="i0">And carry thee away to Seistan,</span><br />
<span class="i0">And place thee on a bed, and mourn for thee,</span><br />
<span class="i0">With the snow-headed Zal, and all my friends.</span><br />
<span class="i0">And I will lay thee in that lovely earth,</span><br />
<span class="i0">And heap a stately mound above thy bones,</span><br />
<span class="i0">And plant a far-seen pillar over all,</span><br />
<span class="i0">And men shall not forget thee in thy grave.</span><br />
<a class="pagebreak" name="page279" id="page279" title="279"></a>
<span class="i0">And I will spare thy host; yea, let them go!</span><br />
<span class="i0">Let them all cross the Oxus back in peace!</span><br />
<span class="i0">What should I do with slaying any more?</span><br />
<span class="i0">For would that all whom I have ever slain</span><br />
<span class="i0">Might be once more alive&mdash;my bitterest foes,</span><br />
<span class="i0">And they who were called champions in their time,</span><br />
<span class="i0">And through whose death I won that fame I have&mdash;</span><br />
<span class="i0">And I were nothing but a common man,</span><br />
<span class="i0">A poor, mean soldier, and without renown,</span><br />
<span class="i0">So thou mightest live too, my son, my son!</span><br />
<span class="i0">Or rather would that I, even I myself,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Might now be lying on this bloody sand,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Near death, and by an ignorant stroke of thine,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Not thou of mine! and I might die, not thou;</span><br />
<span class="i0">And I, not thou, be borne to Seistan;</span><br />
<span class="i0">And Zal might weep above my grave, not thine;</span><br />
<span class="i0">And say: <i>O Son, I weep thee not too sore,</i></span><br />
<span class="i0"><i>For willingly, I know, thou met'st thine end!</i></span><br />
<span class="i0">But now in blood and battles was my youth,</span><br />
<span class="i0">And full of blood and battles is my age,</span><br />
<span class="i0">And I shall never end this life of blood.&rsquo;</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;Then at the point of death, Sohrab replied:</span><br />
<span class="i0">&lsquo;A life of blood indeed, thou dreadful man!</span><br />
<span class="i0">But thou shalt yet have peace; only not now,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Not yet! but thou shalt have it on that day,</span><br />
<span class="i0">When thou shalt sail in a high-masted ship,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Thou and the other peers of Kai Khosroo</span><br />
<span class="i0">Returning home over the salt blue sea,</span><br />
<span class="i0">From laying thy dear master in his grave.&rsquo;</span></p>

<h3><a class="pagebreak" name="page280" id="page280" title="280"></a>NIGHT</h3>

<p><span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;And Rustum gazed in Sohrab's face, and said:</span><br />
<span class="i0">&lsquo;Soon be that day, my son, and deep that sea!</span><br />
<span class="i0">Till then, if fate so wills, let me endure.&rsquo;</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;He spoke; and Sohrab smiled on him, and took</span><br />
<span class="i0">The spear, and drew it from his side, and eased</span><br />
<span class="i0">His wound's imperious anguish; but the blood</span><br />
<span class="i0">Came welling from the open gash, and life</span><br />
<span class="i0">Flowed with the stream;&mdash;all down his cold white side</span><br />
<span class="i0">The crimson torrent ran, dim now and soiled,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Like the soiled tissue of white violets</span><br />
<span class="i0">Left, freshly gathered, on their native bank,</span><br />
<span class="i0">By children whom their nurses call with haste</span><br />
<span class="i0">Indoors from the sun's eye; his head dropped low,</span><br />
<span class="i0">His limbs grew slack; motionless, white, he lay&mdash;</span><br />
<span class="i0">White, with eyes closed; only when heavy gasps,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Deep heavy gasps quivering through all his frame,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Convulsed him back to life, he opened them,</span><br />
<span class="i0">And fixed them feebly on his father's face;</span><br />
<span class="i0">Till now all strength was ebbed, and from his limbs</span><br />
<span class="i0">Unwillingly the spirit fled away,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Regretting the warm mansion which it left,</span><br />
<span class="i0">And youth, and bloom, and this delightful world.</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;So, on the bloody sand, Sohrab lay dead;</span><br />
<span class="i0">And the great Rustum drew his horseman's cloak</span><br />
<span class="i0">Down o'er his face, and sate by his dead son.</span><br />
<span class="i0">As those black granite pillars once high-reared</span><br />
<span class="i0">By Jemshid in Persepolis, to bear</span><br />
<span class="i0">His house, now 'mid their broken flights of steps</span><br />
<a class="pagebreak" name="page281" id="page281" title="281"></a>
<span class="i0">Lie prone, enormous, down the mountain side,</span><br />
<span class="i0">So in the sand lay Rustum by his son.</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;And night came down over the solemn waste,</span><br />
<span class="i0">And the two gazing hosts, and that sole pair,</span><br />
<span class="i0">And darkened all; and a cold fog, with night,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Crept from the Oxus. Soon a hum arose,</span><br />
<span class="i0">As of a great assembly loosed, and fires</span><br />
<span class="i0">Began to twinkle through the fog; for now</span><br />
<span class="i0">Both armies moved to camp, and took their meal;</span><br />
<span class="i0">The Persians took it on the open sands</span><br />
<span class="i0">Southward, the Tartars by the river marge;</span><br />
<span class="i0">And Rustum and his son were left alone.</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;But the majestic river floated on,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Out of the mist and hum of that low land,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Into the frosty starlight, and there moved,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Rejoicing, through the hushed Chorasmian waste,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Under the solitary moon;&mdash;he flowed</span><br />
<span class="i0">Right for the polar star, past Orgunj&egrave;,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Brimming, and bright, and large; then sands begin</span><br />
<span class="i0">To hem his watery march, and dam his streams,</span><br />
<span class="i0">And split his currents; that for many a league</span><br />
<span class="i0">The shorn and parcelled Oxus strains along</span><br />
<span class="i0">Through beds of sand and matted rushy isles&mdash;</span><br />
<span class="i0">Oxus, forgetting the bright speed he had</span><br />
<span class="i0">In his high mountain cradle in Pamere</span><br />
<span class="i0">A foiled circuitous wanderer&mdash;till at last</span><br />
<span class="i0">The longed-for dash of waves is heard, and wide</span><br />
<span class="i0">His luminous home of waters opens, bright</span><br />
<span class="i0">And tranquil, from whose floor the new-bathed stars</span><br />
<span class="i0">Emerge, and shine upon the Aral Sea.</span></p>

<h2><small><a href="#note_cx">CXI</a></small><br />THE TWO CAPTAINS</h2>

<p><span class="i0">When George the Third was reigning a hundred years ago,</span><br />
<span class="i0">He ordered Captain Farmer to chase the foreign foe.</span><br />
<span class="i0">&lsquo;You're not afraid of shot,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;you're not afraid of wreck,</span><br />
<span class="i0">So cruise about the west of France in the frigate called <i>Quebec</i>.</span></p>

<p><a class="pagebreak" name="page286" id="page286" title="286"></a>
<span class="i0">Quebec was once a Frenchman's town, but twenty years ago</span><br />
<span class="i0">King George the Second sent a man called General Wolfe, you know,</span><br />
<span class="i0">To clamber up a precipice and look into Quebec,</span><br />
<span class="i0">As you'd look down a hatchway when standing on the deck.</span></p>

<p><span class="i0">If Wolfe could beat the Frenchmen then so you can beat them now.</span><br />
<span class="i0">Before he got inside the town he died, I must allow.</span><br />
<span class="i0">But since the town was won for us it is a lucky name,</span><br />
<span class="i0">And you'll remember Wolfe's good work, and you shall do the same.&rsquo;</span></p>

<p><span class="i0">Then Farmer said, &lsquo;I'll try, sir,&rsquo; and Farmer bowed so low</span><br />
<span class="i0">That George could see his pigtail tied in a velvet bow.</span><br />
<span class="i0">George gave him his commission, and that it might be safer,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Signed &lsquo;King of Britain, King of France,&rsquo; and sealed it with a wafer.</span></p>

<p><span class="i0">Then proud was Captain Farmer in a frigate of his own,</span><br />
<span class="i0">And grander on his quarter-deck than George upon the throne.</span><br />
<span class="i0">He'd two guns in his cabin, and on the spar-deck ten,</span><br />
<span class="i0">And twenty on the gun-deck, and more than ten score men.</span></p>

<p><span class="i0">And as a huntsman scours the brakes with sixteen brace of dogs,</span><br />
<span class="i0">With two-and-thirty cannon the ship explored the fogs.</span><br />
<a class="pagebreak" name="page287" id="page287" title="287"></a>
<span class="i0">From Cape la Hogue to Ushant, from Rochefort to Belleisle,</span><br />
<span class="i0">She hunted game till reef and mud were rubbing on her keel.</span></p>

<p><span class="i0">The fogs are dried, the frigate's side is bright with melting tar,</span><br />
<span class="i0">The lad up in the foretop sees square white sails afar;</span><br />
<span class="i0">The east wind drives three square-sailed masts from out the Breton bay,</span><br />
<span class="i0">And &lsquo;Clear for action!&rsquo; Farmer shouts, and reefers yell &lsquo;Hooray!&rsquo;</span></p>

<p><span class="i0">The Frenchman's captain had a name I wish I could pronounce;</span><br />
<span class="i0">A Breton gentleman was he, and wholly free from bounce,</span><br />
<span class="i0">One like those famous fellows who died by guillotine</span><br />
<span class="i0">For honour and the fleurs-de-lys and Antoinette the Queen.</span></p>

<p><span class="i0">The Catholic for Louis, the Protestant for George,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Each captain drew as bright a sword as saintly smiths could forge;</span><br />
<span class="i0">And both were simple seamen, but both could understand</span><br />
<span class="i0">How each was bound to win or die for flag and native land.</span></p>

<p><span class="i0">The French ship was <i>la Surveillante</i>, which means the watchful maid;</span><br />
<span class="i0">She folded up her head-dress and began to cannonade.</span><br />
<a class="pagebreak" name="page288" id="page288" title="288"></a>
<span class="i0">Her hull was clean, and ours was foul; we had to spread more sail.</span><br />
<span class="i0">On canvas, stays, and topsail yards her bullets came like hail.</span></p>

<p><span class="i0">Sore smitten were both captains, and many lads beside,</span><br />
<span class="i0">And still to cut our rigging the foreign gunners tried.</span><br />
<span class="i0">A sail-clad spar came flapping down athwart a blazing gun;</span><br />
<span class="i0">We could not quench the rushing flames, and so the Frenchman won.</span></p>

<p><span class="i0">Our quarter-deck was crowded, the waist was all aglow;</span><br />
<span class="i0">Men hung upon the taffrail half scorched, but loth to go;</span><br />
<span class="i0">Our captain sat where once he stood, and would not quit his chair.</span><br />
<span class="i0">He bade his comrades leap for life, and leave him bleeding there.</span></p>

<p><span class="i0">The guns were hushed on either side, the Frenchmen lowered boats,</span><br />
<span class="i0">They flung us planks and hencoops, and everything that floats.</span><br />
<span class="i0">They risked their lives, good fellows! to bring their rivals aid.</span><br />
<span class="i0">'Twas by the conflagration the peace was strangely made.</span></p>

<p><span class="i0"><i>La Surveillante</i> was like a sieve; the victors had no rest,</span><br />
<span class="i0">They had to dodge the east wind to reach the port of Brest,</span><br />
<a class="pagebreak" name="page289" id="page289" title="289"></a>
<span class="i0">And where the waves leapt lower, and the riddled ship went slower,</span><br />
<span class="i0">In triumph, yet in funeral guise, came fisher-boats to tow her.</span></p>

<p><span class="i0">They dealt with us as brethren, they mourned for Farmer dead;</span><br />
<span class="i0">And as the wounded captives passed each Breton bowed the head.</span><br />
<span class="i0">Then spoke the French Lieutenant, &lsquo;'Twas fire that won, not we.</span><br />
<span class="i0">You never struck your flag to us; you'll go to England free.&rsquo;</span></p>

<p><span class="i0">'Twas the sixth day of October, seventeen hundred seventy-nine,</span><br />
<span class="i0">A year when nations ventured against us to combine,</span><br />
<span class="i0"><i>Quebec</i> was burnt and Farmer slain, by us remembered not;</span><br />
<span class="i0">But thanks be to the French book wherein they're not forgot.</span></p>

<p><span class="i0">Now you, if you've to fight the French, my youngster, bear in mind</span><br />
<span class="i0">Those seamen of King Louis so chivalrous and kind;</span><br />
<span class="i0">Think of the Breton gentlemen who took our lads to Brest,</span><br />
<span class="i0">And treat some rescued Breton as a comrade and a guest.</span></p>

<h2><small><a href="#note_cxiii">CXIII</a></small><br />THE SLAYING OF THE NIBLUNGS</h2>

<h3>HOGNI</h3>

<p><span class="i0">Ye shall know that in Atli's feast-hall on the side that joined the house</span><br />
<span class="i0">Were many carven doorways whose work was glorious</span><br />
<span class="i0">With marble stones and gold-work, and their doors of beaten brass:</span><br />
<span class="i0">Lo now, in the merry morning how the story cometh to pass!</span><br />
<span class="i0">&mdash;While the echoes of the trumpet yet fill the people's ears,</span><br />
<span class="i0">And Hogni casts by the war-horn, and his Dwarf-wrought sword uprears,</span><br />
<span class="i0">All those doors aforesaid open, and in pour the streams of steel,</span><br />
<span class="i0">The best of the Eastland champions, the bold men of Atli's weal:</span><br />
<a class="pagebreak" name="page294" id="page294" title="294"></a>
<span class="i0">They raise no cry of battle nor cast forth threat of woe,</span><br />
<span class="i0">And their helmed and hidden faces from each other none may know:</span><br />
<span class="i0">Then a light in the hall ariseth, and the fire of battle runs</span><br />
<span class="i0">All adown the front of the Niblungs in the face of the mighty ones;</span><br />
<span class="i0">All eyes are set upon them, hard drawn is every breath,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Ere the foremost points be mingled and death be blent with death.</span><br />
<span class="i0">&mdash;All eyes save the eyes of Hogni; but e'en as the edges meet,</span><br />
<span class="i0">He turneth about for a moment to the gold of the kingly seat,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Then aback to the front of battle; there then, as the lightning-flash</span><br />
<span class="i0">Through the dark night showeth the city when the clouds of heaven clash,</span><br />
<span class="i0">And the gazer shrinketh backward, yet he seeth from end to end</span><br />
<span class="i0">The street and the merry market, and the windows of his friend,</span><br />
<span class="i0">And the pavement where his footsteps yester'en returning trod,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Now white and changed and dreadful 'neath the threatening voice of God;</span><br />
<span class="i0">So Hogni seeth Gudrun, and the face he used to know,</span><br />
<a class="pagebreak" name="page295" id="page295" title="295"></a>
<span class="i0">Unspeakable, unchanging, with white unknitted brow</span><br />
<span class="i0">With half-closed lips untrembling, with deedless hands and cold</span><br />
<span class="i0">Laid still on knees that stir not, and the linen's moveless fold.</span></p>

<p><span class="i0">Turned Hogni unto the spear-wall, and smote from where he stood,</span><br />
<span class="i0">And hewed with his sword two-handed as the axe-man in a wood:</span><br />
<span class="i0">Before his sword was a champion, and the edges clave to the chin,</span><br />
<span class="i0">And the first man fell in the feast-hall of those that should fall therein.</span><br />
<span class="i0">Then man with man was dealing, and the Niblung host of war</span><br />
<span class="i0">Was swept by the leaping iron, as the rock anigh the shore</span><br />
<span class="i0">By the ice-cold waves of winter: yet a moment Gunnar stayed</span><br />
<span class="i0">As high in his hand unblooded he shook his awful blade;</span><br />
<span class="i0">And he cried: &lsquo;O Eastland champions, do ye behold it here,</span><br />
<span class="i0">The sword of the ancient Giuki? Fall on and have no fear,</span><br />
<span class="i0">But slay and be slain and be famous, if your master's will it be!</span><br />
<span class="i0">Yet are we the blameless Niblungs, and bidden guests are we:</span><br />
<a class="pagebreak" name="page296" id="page296" title="296"></a>
<span class="i0">So forbear, if ye wander hood-winked, nor for nothing slay and be slain;</span><br />
<span class="i0">For I know not what to tell you of the dead that live again.&rsquo;</span></p>

<p><span class="i0">So he saith in the midst of the foemen with his war-flame reared on high,</span><br />
<span class="i0">But all about and around him goes up a bitter cry</span><br />
<span class="i0">From the iron men of Atli, and the bickering of the steel</span><br />
<span class="i0">Sends a roar up to the roof-ridge, and the Niblung war-ranks reel</span><br />
<span class="i0">Behind the steadfast Gunnar: but lo! have ye seen the corn,</span><br />
<span class="i0">While yet men grind the sickle, by the wind-streak overborne</span><br />
<span class="i0">When the sudden rain sweeps downward, and summer groweth black,</span><br />
<span class="i0">And the smitten wood-side roareth 'neath the driving thunder-wrack?</span><br />
<span class="i0">So before the wise-heart Hogni shrank the champions of the East,</span><br />
<span class="i0">As his great voice shook the timbers in the hall of Atli's feast.</span><br />
<span class="i0">There he smote, and beheld not the smitten, and by nought were his edges stopped;</span><br />
<span class="i0">He smote, and the dead were thrust from him; a hand with its shield he lopped;</span><br />
<span title="Original reads 'Alti's'" class="i0">There met him Atli's marshal, and his arm at the shoulder he shred;</span><br />
<span class="i0">Three swords were upreared against him of the best of the kin of the dead;</span><br />
<a class="pagebreak" name="page297" id="page297" title="297"></a>
<span class="i0">And he struck off a head to the rightward, and his sword through a throat he thrust,</span><br />
<span class="i0">But the third stroke fell on his helm-crest, and he stooped to the ruddy dust,</span><br />
<span class="i0">And uprose as the ancient Giant, and both his hands were wet:</span><br />
<span class="i0">Red then was the world to his eyen, as his hand to the labour he set;</span><br />
<span class="i0">Swords shook and fell in his pathway, huge bodies leapt and fell,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Harsh grided shield and war-helm like the tempest-smitten bell,</span><br />
<span class="i0">And the war-cries ran together, and no man his brother knew,</span><br />
<span class="i0">And the dead men loaded the living, as he went the war-wood through;</span><br />
<span class="i0">And man 'gainst man was huddled, till no sword rose to smite,</span><br />
<span class="i0">And clear stood the glorious Hogni in an island of the fight,</span><br />
<span class="i0">And there ran a river of death 'twixt the Niblung and his foes,</span><br />
<span class="i0">And therefrom the terror of men and the wrath of the Gods arose.</span></p>

<h3>GUNNAR</h3>

<p><span class="i0">Now fell the sword of Gunnar, and rose up red in the air,</span><br />
<span class="i0">And hearkened the song of the Niblung, as his voice rang glad and clear,</span><br />
<a class="pagebreak" name="page298" id="page298" title="298"></a>
<span class="i0">And rejoiced and leapt at the Eastmen, and cried as it met the rings</span><br />
<span class="i0">Of a Giant of King Atli and a murder-wolf of kings;</span><br />
<span class="i0">But it quenched its thirst in his entrails, and knew the heart in his breast,</span><br />
<span class="i0">And hearkened the praise of Gunnar, and lingered not to rest,</span><br />
<span class="i0">But fell upon Atli's brother, and stayed not in his brain;</span><br />
<span class="i0">Then he fell, and the King leapt over, and clave a neck atwain,</span><br />
<span class="i0">And leapt o'er the sweep of a pole-axe, and thrust a lord in the throat,</span><br />
<span class="i0">And King Atli's banner-bearer through shield and hauberk smote;</span><br />
<span class="i0">Then he laughed on the huddled East-folk, and against their war-shields drave</span><br />
<span class="i0">While the white swords tossed about him, and that archer's skull he clave</span><br />
<span class="i0">Whom Atli had bought in the Southlands for many a pound of gold;</span><br />
<span class="i0">And the dark-skinned fell upon Gunnar, and over his war-shield rolled,</span><br />
<span class="i0">And cumbered his sword for a season, and the many blades fell on,</span><br />
<span class="i0">And sheared the cloudy helm-crest and rents in his hauberk won,</span><br />
<span class="i0">And the red blood ran from Gunnar; till that Giuki's sword outburst,</span><br />
<span class="i0">As the fire-tongue from the smoulder that the leafy heap hath nursed,</span><br />
<a class="pagebreak" name="page299" id="page299" title="299"></a>
<span class="i0">And unshielded smote King Gunnar, and sent the Niblung song</span><br />
<span class="i0">Through the quaking stems of battle in the hall of Atli's wrong:</span><br />
<span class="i0">Then he rent the knitted war-hedge till by Hogni's side he stood,</span><br />
<span class="i0">And kissed him amidst of the spear-hail, and their cheeks were wet with blood.</span></p>

<p><span class="i0">Then on came the Niblung bucklers, and they drave the East-folk home,</span><br />
<span class="i0">As the bows of the oar-driven long-ship beat off the waves in foam:</span><br />
<span class="i0">They leave their dead behind them, and they come to the doors and the wall,</span><br />
<span class="i0">And a few last spears from the fleeing amidst their shield-hedge fall:</span><br />
<span class="i0">But the doors clash to in their faces, as the fleeing rout they drive,</span><br />
<span class="i0">And fain would follow after; and none is left alive</span><br />
<span class="i0">In the feast-hall of King Atli, save those fishes of the net,</span><br />
<span class="i0">And the white and silent woman above the slaughter set.</span></p>

<p><span class="i0">Then biddeth the heart-wise Hogni, and men to the windows climb,</span><br />
<span class="i0">And uplift the war-grey corpses, dead drift of the stormy time,</span><br />
<span class="i0">And cast them adown to their people: thence they come aback and say</span><br />
<span class="i0">That scarce shall ye see the houses, and no whit the wheel-worn way</span><br />
<a class="pagebreak" name="page300" id="page300" title="300"></a>
<span class="i0">For the spears and shields of the Eastlands that the merchant city throng;</span><br />
<span class="i0">And back to the Niblung burg-gate the way seemed weary-long.</span></p>

<p><span class="i0">Yet passeth hour on hour, and the doors they watch and ward</span><br />
<span class="i0">But a long while hear no mail-clash, nor the ringing of the sword;</span><br />
<span class="i0">Then droop the Niblung children, and their wounds are waxen chill,</span><br />
<span class="i0">And they think of the burg by the river, and the builded holy hill,</span><br />
<span class="i0">And their eyes are set on Gudrun as of men who would beseech;</span><br />
<span class="i0">But unlearned are they in craving, and know not dastard's speech.</span><br />
<span class="i0">Then doth Giuki's first-begotten a deed most fair to be told,</span><br />
<span class="i0">For his fair harp Gunnar taketh, and the warp of silver and gold;</span><br />
<span class="i0">With the hand of a cunning harper he dealeth with the strings,</span><br />
<span class="i0">And his voice in their midst goeth upward, as of ancient days he sings,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Of the days before the Niblungs, and the days that shall be yet;</span><br />
<span class="i0">Till the hour of toil and smiting the warrior hearts forget,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Nor hear the gathering foemen, nor the sound of swords aloof:</span><br />
<a class="pagebreak" name="page301" id="page301" title="301"></a>
<span class="i0">Then clear the song of Gunnar goes up to the dusky roof,</span><br />
<span class="i0">And the coming spear-host tarries, and the bearers of the woe</span><br />
<span class="i0">Through the cloisters of King Atli with lingering footsteps go.</span></p>

<p><span class="i0">But Hogni looketh on Gudrun, and no change in her face he sees,</span><br />
<span class="i0">And no stir in her folded linen and the deedless hands on her knees:</span><br />
<span class="i0">Then from Gunnar's side he hasteneth; and lo! the open door,</span><br />
<span class="i0">And a foeman treadeth the pavement, and his lips are on Atli's floor,</span><br />
<span class="i0">For Hogni is death in the doorway: then the Niblungs turn on the foe,</span><br />
<span class="i0">And the hosts are mingled together, and blow cries out on blow.</span></p>

<h3>GUDRUN</h3>

<p><span class="i0">Still the song goeth up from Gunnar, though his harp to earth be laid;</span><br />
<span class="i0">But he fighteth exceeding wisely, and is many a warrior's aid,</span><br />
<span class="i0">And he shieldeth and delivereth, and his eyes search through the hall,</span><br />
<span class="i0">And woe is he for his fellows, as his battle-brethren fall;</span><br />
<span class="i0">For the turmoil hideth little from that glorious folk-king's eyes,</span><br />
<span class="i0">And o'er all he beholdeth Gudrun, and his soul is waxen wise,</span><br />
<a class="pagebreak" name="page302" id="page302" title="302"></a>
<span class="i0">And he saith: &lsquo;We shall look on Sigurd, and Sigmund of old days,</span><br />
<span class="i0">And see the boughs of the Branstock o'er the ancient Volsung's praise.&rsquo;</span></p>

<p><span class="i0">Woe's me for the wrath of Hogni! From the door he giveth aback</span><br />
<span class="i0">That the Eastland slayers may enter to the murder and the wrack:</span><br />
<span class="i0">Then he rageth and driveth the battle to the golden kingly seat,</span><br />
<span class="i0">And the last of the foes he slayeth by Gudrun's very feet,</span><br />
<span class="i0">That the red blood splasheth her raiment; and his own blood therewithal</span><br />
<span class="i0">He casteth aloft before her, and the drops on her white hands fall:</span><br />
<span class="i0">But nought she seeth or heedeth, and again he turns to fight,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Nor heedeth stroke nor wounding so he a foe may smite:</span><br />
<span class="i0">Then the battle opens before him, and the Niblungs draw to his side;</span><br />
<span class="i0">As death in the world first fashioned, through the feast-hall doth he stride.</span><br />
<span class="i0">And so once more do the Niblungs sweep that murder-flood of men</span><br />
<span class="i0">From the hall of toils and treason, and the doors swing to again.</span><br />
<span class="i0">Then again is there peace for a little within the fateful fold;</span><br />
<a class="pagebreak" name="page303" id="page303" title="303"></a>
<span class="i0">But the Niblungs look about them, and but few folk they behold</span><br />
<span class="i0">Upright on their feet for the battle: now they climb aloft no more,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Nor cast the dead from the windows; but they raise a rampart of war,</span><br />
<span class="i0">And its stones are the fallen East-folk, and no lowly wall is that.</span></p>

<p><span class="i0">Therein was Gunnar the mighty: on the shields of men he sat,</span><br />
<span class="i0">And the sons of his people hearkened, for his hand through the harp-strings ran,</span><br />
<span class="i0">And he sang in the hall of his foeman of the Gods and the making of man,</span><br />
<span class="i0">And how season was sundered from season in the days of the fashioning,</span><br />
<span class="i0">And became the Summer and Autumn, and became the Winter and Spring;</span><br />
<span class="i0">He sang of men's hunger and labour, and their love and their breeding of broil.</span><br />
<span class="i0">And their hope that is fostered of famine, and their rest that is fashioned of toil:</span><br />
<span class="i0">Fame then and the sword he sang of, and the hour of the hardy and wise,</span><br />
<span class="i0">When the last of the living shall perish, and the first of the dead shall arise,</span><br />
<span class="i0">And the torch shall be lit in the daylight, and God unto man shall pray,</span><br />
<span class="i0">And the heart shall cry out for the hand in the fight of the uttermost day.</span><br />
<a class="pagebreak" name="page304" id="page304" title="304"></a>
<span class="i0">So he sang, and beheld not Gudrun, save as long ago he saw</span><br />
<span class="i0">His sister, the little maiden of the face without a flaw:</span><br />
<span class="i0">But wearily Hogni beheld her, and no change in her face there was,</span><br />
<span class="i0">And long thereon gazed Hogni, and set his brows as the brass,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Though the hands of the King were weary, and weak his knees were grown,</span><br />
<span class="i0">And he felt as a man unholpen in a waste land wending alone.</span></p>

<h3>THE SONS OF GIUKI</h3>

<p><span class="i0">Now the noon was long passed over when again the rumour arose,</span><br />
<span class="i0">And through the doors cast open flowed in the river of foes:</span><br />
<span class="i0">They flooded the hall of the murder, and surged round that rampart of dead;</span><br />
<span class="i0">No war-duke ran before them, no lord to the onset led,</span><br />
<span class="i0">But the thralls shot spears at adventure, and shot out shafts from afar,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Till the misty hall was blinded with the bitter drift of war:</span><br />
<span class="i0">Few and faint were the Niblung children, and their wounds were waxen acold,</span><br />
<span class="i0">And they saw the Hell-gates open as they stood in their grimly hold:</span><br />
<span class="i0">Yet thrice stormed out King Hogni, thrice stormed out Gunnar the King,</span><br />
<a class="pagebreak" name="page305" id="page305" title="305"></a>
<span class="i0">Thrice fell they aback yet living to the heart of the fated ring;</span><br />
<span class="i0">And they looked and their band was little, and no man but was wounded sore,</span><br />
<span class="i0">And the hall seemed growing greater, such hosts of foes it bore,</span><br />
<span class="i0">So tossed the iron harvest from wall to gilded wall;</span><br />
<span class="i0">And they looked and the white-clad Gudrun sat silent over all.</span></p>

<p><span class="i0">Then the churls and thralls of the Eastland howled out as wolves accurst,</span><br />
<span class="i0">But oft gaped the Niblungs voiceless, for they choked with anger and thirst;</span><br />
<span class="i0">And the hall grew hot as a furnace, and men drank their flowing blood,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Men laughed and gnawed on their shield-rims, men knew not where they stood,</span><br />
<span class="i0">And saw not what was before them; as in the dark men smote,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Men died heart-broken, unsmitten; men wept with the cry in the throat,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Men lived on full of war-shafts, men cast their shields aside</span><br />
<span class="i0">And caught the spears to their bosoms; men rushed with none beside,</span><br />
<span class="i0">And fell unarmed on the foemen, and tore and slew in death:</span><br />
<span class="i0">And still down rained the arrows as the rain across the heath;</span><br />
<span class="i0">Still proud o'er all the turmoil stood the Kings of Giuki born,</span><br />
<a class="pagebreak" name="page306" id="page306" title="306"></a>
<span class="i0">Nor knit were the brows of Gunnar, nor his song-speech overworn;</span><br />
<span class="i0">But Hogni's mouth kept silence, and oft his heart went forth</span><br />
<span class="i0">To the long, long day of the darkness, and the end of worldly worth.</span></p>

<p><span class="i0">Loud rose the roar of the East-folk, and the end was coming at last:</span><br />
<span class="i0">Now the foremost locked their shield-rims and the hindmost over them cast,</span><br />
<span class="i0">And nigher they drew and nigher, and their fear was fading away,</span><br />
<span class="i0">For every man of the Niblungs on the shaft-strewn pavement lay,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Save Gunnar the King and Hogni: still the glorious King up-bore</span><br />
<span class="i0">The cloudy shield of the Niblungs set full of shafts of war;</span><br />
<span class="i0">But Hogni's hands had fainted, and his shield had sunk adown,</span><br />
<span class="i0">So thick with the Eastland spearwood was that rampart of renown;</span><br />
<span class="i0">And hacked and dull were the edges that had rent the wall of foes:</span><br />
<span class="i0">Yet he stood upright by Gunnar before that shielded close,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Nor looked on the foeman's faces as their wild eyes drew anear,</span><br />
<span class="i0">And their faltering shield-rims clattered with the remnant of their fear;</span><br />
<a class="pagebreak" name="page307" id="page307" title="307"></a>
<span class="i0">But he gazed on the Niblung woman, and the daughter of his folk,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Who sat o'er all unchanging ere the war-cloud over them broke.</span></p>

<p><span class="i0">Now nothing might men hearken in the house of Atli's weal,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Save the feet slow tramping onward, and the rattling of the steel,</span><br />
<span class="i0">And the song of the glorious Gunnar, that rang as clearly now</span><br />
<span class="i0">As the speckled storm-cock singeth from the scant-leaved hawthorn-bough,</span><br />
<span class="i0">When the sun is dusking over and the March snow pelts the land.</span><br />
<span class="i0">There stood the mighty Gunnar with sword and shield in hand,</span><br />
<span class="i0">There stood the shieldless Hogni with set unangry eyes,</span><br />
<span class="i0">And watched the wall of war-shields o'er the dead men's rampart rise,</span><br />
<span class="i0">And the white blades flickering nigher, and the quavering points of war.</span><br />
<span class="i0">Then the heavy air of the feast-hall was rent with a fearful roar,</span><br />
<span class="i0">And the turmoil came and the tangle, as the wall together ran:</span><br />
<span class="i0">But aloft yet towered the Niblungs, and man toppled over man,</span><br />
<span class="i0">And leapt and struggled to tear them; as whiles amidst the sea</span><br />
<a class="pagebreak" name="page308" id="page308" title="308"></a>
<span class="i0">The doomed ship strives its utmost with mid-ocean's mastery,</span><br />
<span class="i0">And the tall masts whip the cordage, while the welter whirls and leaps,</span><br />
<span class="i0">And they rise and reel and waver, and sink amid the deeps:</span><br />
<span class="i0">So before the little-hearted in King Atli's murder-hall</span><br />
<span class="i0">Did the glorious sons of Giuki 'neath the shielded onrush fall:</span><br />
<span class="i0">Sore wounded, bound and helpless, but living yet, they lie</span><br />
<span class="i0">Till the afternoon and the even in the first of night shall die.</span></p>

<p><span class="i0">Oft in the pleasant summer years,</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;Reading the tales of days bygone,</span><br />
<span class="i0">I have mused on the story of human tears,</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;All that man unto man has done,</span><br />
<a class="pagebreak" name="page312" id="page312" title="312"></a>
<span class="i0">Massacre, torture, and black despair;</span><br />
<span class="i0">Reading it all in my easy-chair.</span></p>

<p><span class="i0">Passionate prayer for a minute's life;</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;Tortured crying for death as rest;</span><br />
<span class="i0">Husband pleading for child or wife,</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;Pitiless stroke upon tender breast.</span><br />
<span class="i0">Was it all real as that I lay there</span><br />
<span class="i0">Lazily stretched on my easy-chair?</span></p>

<p><span class="i0">Could I believe in those hard old times,</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;Here in this safe luxurious age?</span><br />
<span class="i0">Were the horrors invented to season rhymes,</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;Or truly is man so fierce in his rage?</span><br />
<span class="i0">What could I suffer, and what could I dare?</span><br />
<span class="i0">I who was bred to that easy-chair.</span></p>

<p><span class="i0">They were my fathers, the men of yore,</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;Little they recked of a cruel death;</span><br />
<span class="i0">They would dip their hands in a heretic's gore,</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;They stood and burnt for a rule of faith.</span><br />
<span class="i0">What would I burn for, and whom not spare?</span><br />
<span class="i0">I, who had faith in an easy-chair.</span></p>

<p><span class="i0">Now do I see old tales are true,</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;Here in the clutch of a savage foe;</span><br />
<span class="i0">Now shall I know what my fathers knew,</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;Bodily anguish and bitter woe,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Naked and bound in the strong sun's glare,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Far from my civilised easy-chair.</span></p>

<p><span class="i0">Now have I tasted and understood</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;That old-world feeling of mortal hate;</span><br />
<a class="pagebreak" name="page313" id="page313" title="313"></a>
<span class="i0">For the eyes all round us are hot with blood;</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;They will kill us coolly&mdash;they do but wait;</span><br />
<span class="i0">While I, I would sell ten lives, at least,</span><br />
<span class="i0">For one fair stroke at that devilish priest.</span></p>

<p><span class="i0">Just in return for the kick he gave,</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;Bidding me call on the prophet's name;</span><br />
<span class="i0">Even a dog by this may save</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;Skin from the knife and soul from the flame;</span><br />
<span class="i0">My soul! if he can let the prophet burn it,</span><br />
<span class="i0">But life is sweet if a word may earn it.</span></p>

<p><span class="i0">A bullock's death, and at thirty years!</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;Just one phrase, and a man gets off it;</span><br />
<span class="i0">Look at that mongrel clerk in his tears</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;Whining aloud the name of the prophet;</span><br />
<span class="i0">Only a formula easy to patter,</span><br />
<span class="i0">And, God Almighty, what <i>can</i> it matter?</span></p>

<p><span class="i0">&lsquo;Matter enough,&rsquo; will my comrade say</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;Praying aloud here close at my side,</span><br />
<span class="i0">&lsquo;Whether you mourn in despair alway,</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;Cursed for ever by Christ denied;</span><br />
<span class="i0">Or whether you suffer a minute's pain</span><br />
<span class="i0">All the reward of Heaven to gain.&rsquo;</span></p>

<p><span class="i0">Not for a moment faltereth he,</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;Sure of the promise and pardon of sin;</span><br />
<span class="i0">Thus did the martyrs die, I see,</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;Little to lose and muckle to win;</span><br />
<span class="i0">Death means Heaven, he longs to receive it,</span><br />
<span class="i0">But what shall I do if I don't believe it?</span></p>

<p><a class="pagebreak" name="page314" id="page314" title="314"></a>
<span class="i0">Life is pleasant, and friends may be nigh,</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;Fain would I speak one word and be spared;</span><br />
<span class="i0">Yet I could be silent and cheerfully die,</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;If I were only sure God cared;</span><br />
<span class="i0">If I had faith, and were only certain</span><br />
<span class="i0">That light is behind that terrible curtain.</span></p>

<p><span class="i0">But what if He listeth nothing at all,</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;Of words a poor wretch in his terror may say</span><br />
<span class="i0">That mighty God who created all</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;To labour and live their appointed day;</span><br />
<span class="i0">Who stoops not either to bless or ban,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Weaving the woof of an endless plan.</span></p>

<p><span class="i0">He is the Reaper, and binds the sheaf,</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;Shall not the season its order keep?</span><br />
<span class="i0">Can it be changed by a man's belief?</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;Millions of harvests still to reap;</span><br />
<span class="i0">Will God reward, if I die for a creed,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Or will He but pity, and sow more seed?</span></p>

<p><span class="i0">Surely He pities who made the brain,</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;When breaks that mirror of memories sweet,</span><br />
<span class="i0">When the hard blow falleth, and never again</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;Nerve shall quiver nor pulse shall beat;</span><br />
<span class="i0">Bitter the vision of vanishing joys;</span><br />
<span class="i0">Surely He pities when man destroys.</span></p>

<p><span class="i0">Here stand I on the ocean's brink,</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;Who hath brought news of the further shore?</span><br />
<span class="i0">How shall I cross it? Sail or sink,</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;One thing is sure, I return no more;</span><br />
<span class="i0">Shall I find haven, or aye shall I be</span><br />
<span class="i0">Tossed in the depths of a shoreless sea?</span></p>

<span class="i0">He's up and away from Fort Bukloh as fast as he can fly,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Till he was aware of his father's mare in the gut of the Tongue of Jagai,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Till he was aware of his father's mare with Kamal upon her back,</span><br />
<span class="i0">And when he could spy the white of her eye, he made the pistol crack.</span><br />
<span class="i0">He has fired once, he has fired twice, but the whistling ball went wide.</span><br />
<span class="i0">&lsquo;Ye shoot like a soldier,&rsquo; Kamal said. &lsquo;Show now if ye can ride.&rsquo;</span><br />
<span class="i0">It's up and over the Tongue of Jagai, as blown dust-devils go,</span><br />
<span class="i0">The dun he fled like a stag of ten, but the mare like a barren doe.</span><br />
<a class="pagebreak" name="page331" id="page331" title="331"></a>
<span class="i0">The dun he leaned against the bit and slugged his head above,</span><br />
<span class="i0">But the red mare played with the snaffle-bars as a lady plays with a glove.</span><br />
<span class="i0">They have ridden the low moon out of the sky, their hoofs drum up the dawn,</span><br />
<span class="i0">The dun he went like a wounded bull, but the mare like a new-roused fawn.</span><br />
<span class="i0">The dun he fell at a water-course&mdash;in a woful heap fell he,&mdash;</span><br />
<span class="i0">And Kamal has turned the red mare back, and pulled the rider free.</span><br />
<span class="i0">He has knocked the pistol out of his hand&mdash;small room was there to strive&mdash;</span><br />
<span class="i0">&lsquo;'Twas only by favour of mine,&rsquo; quoth he, &lsquo;ye rode so long alive;</span><br />
<span class="i0">There was not a rock for twenty mile, there was not a clump of tree,</span><br />
<span class="i0">But covered a man of my own men with his rifle cocked on his knee.</span><br />
<span class="i0">If I had raised my bridle-hand, as I have held it low,</span><br />
<span class="i0">The little jackals that flee so fast were feasting all in a row;</span><br />
<span class="i0">If I had bowed my head on my breast, as I have held it high,</span><br />
<span class="i0">The kite that whistles above us now were gorged till she could not fly.&rsquo;</span><br />
<span class="i0">Lightly answered the Colonel's son:&mdash;&lsquo;Do good to bird and beast,</span><br />
<span class="i0">But count who come for the broken meats before thou makest a feast.</span><br />
<a class="pagebreak" name="page332" id="page332" title="332"></a>
<span class="i0">If there should follow a thousand swords to carry my bones away,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Belike the price of a jackal's meal were more than a thief could pay.</span><br />
<span class="i0">They will feed their horse on the standing crop, their men on the garnered grain,</span><br />
<span class="i0">The thatch of the byres will serve their fires when all the cattle are slain.</span><br />
<span class="i0">But if thou thinkest the price be fair, and thy brethren wait to sup,</span><br />
<span class="i0">The hound is kin to the jackal-spawn,&mdash;howl, dog, and call them up!</span><br />
<span class="i0">And if thou thinkest the price be high, in steer and gear and stack,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Give me my father's mare again, and I'll fight my own way back!&rsquo;</span><br />
<span class="i0">Kamal has gripped him by the hand and set him upon his feet.</span><br />
<span class="i0">&lsquo;No talk shall be of dogs,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;when wolf and grey wolf meet.</span><br />
<span class="i0">May I eat dirt if thou hast hurt of me in deed or breath.</span><br />
<span class="i0">What dam of lances brought thee forth to jest at the dawn with Death?&rsquo;</span><br />
<span class="i0">Lightly answered the Colonel's son:&mdash;&lsquo;I hold by the blood of my clan;</span><br />
<span class="i0">Take up the mare for my father's gift&mdash;By God she has carried a man!&rsquo;</span><br />
<span class="i0">The red mare ran to the Colonel's son, and nuzzled her nose in his breast,</span><br />
<span class="i0">&lsquo;We be two strong men,&rsquo; said Kamal then, &lsquo;but she loveth the younger best.</span><br />
<a class="pagebreak" name="page333" id="page333" title="333"></a>
<span class="i0">So she shall go with a lifter's dower, my turquoise studded rein,</span><br />
<span class="i0">My broidered saddle and saddle-cloth, and silver stirrups twain.&rsquo;</span><br />
<span class="i0">The Colonel's son a pistol drew and held it muzzle-end,</span><br />
<span class="i0">&lsquo;Ye have taken the one from a foe,&rsquo; said he; &lsquo;will ye take the mate from a friend?&rsquo;</span><br />
<span class="i0">&lsquo;A gift for a gift,&rsquo; said Kamal straight; &lsquo;a limb for the risk of a limb.</span><br />
<span class="i0">Thy father has sent his son to me, I'll send my son to him!&rsquo;</span><br />
<span class="i0">With that he whistled his only son, who dropped from a mountain-crest&mdash;</span><br />
<span class="i0">He trod the ling like a buck in spring and he looked like a lance in rest.</span><br />
<span class="i0">&lsquo;Now here is thy master,&rsquo; Kamal said, &lsquo;who leads a troop of the Guides,</span><br />
<span class="i0">And thou must ride at his left side as shield to shoulder rides.</span><br />
<span class="i0">Till Death or I cut loose the tie, at camp and board and bed,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Thy life is his&mdash;thy fate it is to guard him with thy head.</span><br />
<span class="i0">And thou must eat the White Queen's meat, and all her foes are thine,</span><br />
<span class="i0">And thou must harry thy father's hold for the peace of the Border-line,</span><br />
<span class="i0">And thou must make a trooper tough and hack thy way to power&mdash;</span><br />
<span class="i0">Belike they will raise thee to Ressaldar when I am hanged in Peshawur.&rsquo;</span><br />
<a class="pagebreak" name="page334" id="page334" title="334"></a>
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;They have looked each other between the eyes, and there they found no fault,</span><br />
<span class="i0">They have taken the Oath of the Brother-in-Blood on leavened bread and salt;</span><br />
<span class="i0">They have taken the Oath of the Brother-in-Blood on fire and fresh-cut sod,</span><br />
<span class="i0">On the hilt and the haft of the Khyber knife, and the Wondrous Names of God.</span><br />
<span class="i0">The Colonel's son he rides the mare and Kamal's boy the dun,</span><br />
<span class="i0">And two have come back to Fort Bukloh where there went forth but one.</span><br />
<span class="i0">And when they drew to the Quarter-Guard, full twenty swords flew clear&mdash;</span><br />
<span class="i0">There was not a man but carried his feud with the blood of the mountaineer.</span><br />
<span class="i0">&lsquo;Ha' done! ha' done!&rsquo; said the Colonel's son. &lsquo;Put up the steel at your sides!</span><br />
<span class="i0">Last night ye had struck at a Border thief&mdash;to-night 'tis a man of the Guides!&rsquo;</span></p>

<p><span class="i0">Oh, east is east, and west is west, and never the two shall meet</span><br />
<span class="i0">Till earth and sky stand presently at God's great Judgment Seat.</span><br />
<span class="i0">But there is neither east nor west, border or breed or birth,</span><br />
<span class="i0">When two strong men stand face to face, though they come from the ends of the earth.</span></p>

<p><span class="i0">Winds of the World, give answer! They are whimpering to and fro&mdash;</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;And what should they know of England who only England know?&mdash;</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;The poor little street-bred people that vapour and fume and brag,</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;They are lifting their heads in the stillness to yelp at the English Flag.</span></p>

<p><span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;Must we borrow a clout from the Boer&mdash;to plaster anew with dirt?</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;An Irish liar's bandage, or an English coward's shirt?</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;We may not speak of England; her Flag's to sell or share.</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;What is the Flag of England? Winds of the World, declare!</span></p>

<p><span class="i0">The North Wind blew:&mdash;&lsquo;From Bergen my steel-shod vanguards go;</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;I chase your lazy whalers home from the Disko floe;</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;By the great North Lights above me I work the will of God,</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;And the liner splits on the ice-fields or the Dogger fills with cod.</span></p>

<p><span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;I barred my gates with iron, I shuttered my doors with flame,</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;Because to force my ramparts your nutshell navies came;</span><br />
<a class="pagebreak" name="page336" id="page336" title="336"></a>
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;I took the sun from their presence, I cut them down with my blast,</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;And they died, but the Flag of England blew free ere the spirit passed.</span></p>

<p><span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;The lean white bear hath seen it in the long, long Arctic night,</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;The musk-ox knows the standard that flouts the Northern Light:</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;What is the Flag of England? Ye have but my bergs to dare,</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;Ye have but my drifts to conquer. Go forth, for it is there!&rsquo;</span></p>

<p><span class="i0">The South Wind sighed:&mdash;&lsquo;From the Virgins my mid-sea course was ta'en</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;Over a thousand islands lost in an idle main,</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;Where the sea-egg flames on the coral and the long-backed breakers croon</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;Their endless ocean legends to the lazy, locked lagoon.</span></p>

<p><span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;Strayed amid lonely islets, mazed amid outer keys,</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;I waked the palms to laughter&mdash;I tossed the scud in the breeze&mdash;</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;Never was isle so little, never was sea so lone,</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;But over the scud and the palm trees an English flag was flown.</span></p>

<p><span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;I have wrenched it free from the halliard to hang for a wisp on the Horn;</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;I have chased it north to the Lizard&mdash;ribboned and rolled and torn;</span><br />
<a class="pagebreak" name="page337" id="page337" title="337"></a>
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;I have spread its fold o'er the dying, adrift in a hopeless sea;</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;I have hurled it swift on the slaver, and seen the slave set free.</span></p>

<p><span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;My basking sunfish know it, and wheeling albatross,</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;Where the lone wave fills with fire beneath the Southern Cross.</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;What is the Flag of England? Ye have but my reefs to dare,</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;Ye have but my seas to furrow. Go forth, for it is there!&rsquo;</span></p>

<p><span class="i0">The East Wind roared:&mdash;&lsquo;From the Kuriles, the Bitter Seas, I come,</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;And me men call the Home-Wind, for I bring the English home.</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;Look&mdash;look well to your shipping! By the breath of my mad typhoon</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;I swept your close-packed Praya and beached your best at Kowloon!</span></p>

<p><span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;The reeling junks behind me and the racing seas before,</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;I raped your richest roadstead&mdash;I plundered Singapore!</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;I set my hand on the Hoogli; as a hooded snake she rose,</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;And I heaved your stoutest steamers to roost with the startled crows.</span></p>

<p><span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;Never the lotos closes, never the wild-fowl wake.</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;But a soul goes out on the East Wind that died for England's sake&mdash;</span><br />
<a class="pagebreak" name="page338" id="page338" title="338"></a>
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;Man or woman or suckling, mother or bride or maid&mdash;</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;Because on the bones of the English the English Flag is stayed.</span></p>

<p><span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;The desert-dust hath dimmed it, the flying wild-ass knows,</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;The scared white leopard winds it across the taintless snows.</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;What is the Flag of England? Ye have but my sun to dare,</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;Ye have but my sands to travel. Go forth, for it is there!&rsquo;</span></p>

<p><span class="i0">The West Wind called:&mdash;&lsquo;In squadrons the thoughtless galleons fly</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;That bear the wheat and cattle lest street-bred people die.</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;They make my might their porter, they make my house their path,</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;And I loose my neck from their service and whelm them all in my wrath.</span></p>

<p><span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;I draw the gliding fog-bank as a snake is drawn from the hole,</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;They bellow one to the other, the frighted ship-bells toll:</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;For day is a drifting terror till I raise the shroud with my breath,</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;And they see strange bows above them and the two go locked to death.</span></p>

<p><a class="pagebreak" name="page339" id="page339" title="339"></a>
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;But whether in calm or wrack-wreath, whether by dark or day</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;I heave them whole to the conger or rip their plates away,</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;First of the scattered legions, under a shrieking sky,</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;Dipping between the rollers, the English Flag goes by.</span></p>

<p><span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;The dead dumb fog hath wrapped it&mdash;the frozen dews have kissed&mdash;</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;The morning stars have hailed it, a fellow-star in the mist.</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp;&nbsp;What is the Flag of England? Ye have but my breath to dare,</span><br />

<h2><a name="page340" id="page340"></a><a class="pagebreak" name="page341" id="page341" title="341"></a>NOTES</h2>

<h3><a name="note_i" id="note_i"></a><a href="#page1">I</a></h3>

<p>This descant upon one of the most glorious feats of arms that
even England has achieved is selected and pieced together from
the magnificent verse assigned to the Chorus&mdash;&lsquo;<i>Enter <strong>Rumour</strong>
painted full of tongues</i>&rsquo;&mdash;to <i>King Henry V.</i>, the noble piece of
pageantry produced in 1598, and a famous number from the <i>Poems
Lyrick and Pastorall</i> (<i>circ.</i> 1605) of Michael Drayton. &lsquo;Look,&rsquo;
says Ben Jonson, in his <i>Vision on the Muses of his Friend, Michael
Drayton</i>:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="poetry"><p>
<span class="i0">Look how we read the Spartans were inflamed</span><br />
<span class="i0">With bold Tyrt&aelig;us' verse; when thou art named</span><br />
<span class="i0">So shall our English youths urge on, and cry</span><br />
<span class="i0">An <strong>Agincourt!</strong> an <strong>Agincourt!</strong> or die.</span></p>
</blockquote>

<p>This, it is true, was in respect of another <i>Agincourt</i>, but we need
not hesitate to appropriate it to our own: in respect of which&mdash;&lsquo;To
the Cambro-Britons and their Harp, His <i>Ballad of Agincourt</i>,&rsquo; is
the poet's own description&mdash;it is to note that Drayton had no
model for it; that it remains wellnigh unique in English letters for
over two hundred years; and that, despite such lapses into doggerel
as the third stanza, and some curious infelicities of diction
which need not here be specified, it remains, with a certain Sonnet,
its author's chief title to fame. Compare the ballads of <i>The Brave
Lord Willoughby</i> and <i>The Honour of Bristol</i> in the seventeenth
century, the song of <i>The Arethusa</i> in the eighteenth, and in the
nineteenth a choice of such Tyrt&aelig;an music as <i>The Battle of the Baltic</i>,
Lord Tennyson's <i>Ballad of the Fleet</i>, and <i>The Red Thread of
Honour</i> of the late Sir Francis Doyle.</p>

<h3><a name="note_ii" id="note_ii"></a><a href="#page11">II</a></h3>

<p>Originally <i>The True Character of a Happy Life</i>: written and
printed about 1614, and reprinted by Percy (1765) from the <i>Reliqui&aelig;
Wottonian&aelig;</i> of 1651. Says Drummond of Ben Jonson, &lsquo;Sir
Edward (<i>sic</i>) Wotton's verses of a Happy Life he hath by heart.&rsquo;
Of Wotton himself it was reserved for Cowley to remark that</p>

<blockquote class="poetry"><p>
<span class="i0">He did the utmost bounds of knowledge find,</span><br />
<span class="i0">And found them not so large as was his mind;</span></p>

<hr />

<p><span class="i0">And when he saw that he through all had passed</span><br />
<span class="i0">He died&mdash;lest he should idle grow at last.</span></p>

<p>From <i>Underwoods</i> (1640). The first, <i>An Ode</i>, is addressed to an
innominate not yet, I believe, identified. The second is part of
that <i>Ode to the Immortal Memory of that Heroic Pair, Sir Lucius
Cary and Sir Henry Morrison</i>, which is the first true Pindaric in
the language. Gifford ascribes it to 1629, when Sir Henry died,
but it seems not to have been printed before 1640. Sir Lucius
Cary is the Lord Falkland of Clarendon and Horace Walpole.</p>

<p>First printed, Mr. Bullen tells me, in 1640. Compare X.

World</i>: &lsquo;O Eloquent, Just, and Mighty Death! Whom none

hast done; and whom all the World hath flattered, thou only hast
cast out of the World and despised: thou hast drawn together all
the far-stretched Greatness, all the Pride, Cruelty, and Ambition
of Man, and covered it all over with these two narrow words,

<p>No. 61, &lsquo;<i>Vertue</i>,&rsquo; in <i>The Temple: Sacred Poems and Private
Ejaculations</i>, 1632&ndash;33. Compare Herbert to Christopher Farrer,
as reported by Izaak Walton:&mdash;&lsquo;Tell him that I do not repine,
but am pleased with my want of health; and tell him, my heart is
fixed on that place where true joy is only to be found, and that I
long to be there, and do wait for my appointed change with hope
and patience.&rsquo;</p>

<h3><a name="note_x" id="note_x"></a><a href="#page20">X</a></h3>

VI. (Beaumont, <i>ante</i>, p. <a href="#page15">15</a>), and Bacon, <i>Essays</i>, &lsquo;On Death&rsquo;:
<a class="pagebreak" name="page343" id="page343" title="343"></a>
&lsquo;But, above all, believe it, the sweetest canticle is <i>Nunc dimittis</i>,
when a man hath attained worthy ends and expectations.&rsquo;</p>

<h3><a name="note_xi" id="note_xi"></a><a href="#page21">XI</a></h3>

<p>Written in the November of 1637, and printed next year in
the <i>Obsequies to the Memorie of Mr. Edward King</i>. &lsquo;In this
Monody,&rsquo; the title runs, &lsquo;the Author bewails a Learned Friend
unfortunately drowned in his passage from Chester on the Irish
Seas, 1637. And by occasion foretells the ruine of our corrupted
Clergie, then in their height.&rsquo; King, who died at five- or six-and-twenty,
was a personal friend of Milton's, but the true accents
of grief are inaudible in <i>Lycidas</i>, which is, indeed, an example
as perfect as exists of Milton's capacity for turning whatever he
touched into pure poetry: an arrangement, that is, of &lsquo;the best
words in the best order&rsquo;; or, to go still further than Coleridge, the
best words in the prescribed or inevitable sequence that makes the
arrangement art. For the innumerable allusions see Professor
Masson's edition of Milton (Macmillan, 1890), i. 187&ndash;201, and
iii. 254&ndash;276.</p>

Cromwell, May, 1652: On the Proposals of Certain Ministers at

and against the intolerant Fifteen Proposals of John
Owen and the majority of the Committee.</p>

<h3><a name="note_xiv" id="note_xiv"></a><a href="#page28">XIV</a></h3>

<p>The Eighteenth Sonnet (Masson). &lsquo;Written in 1655,&rsquo; says
Masson, and referring &lsquo;to the persecution instituted, in the early
part of the year, by Charles Emmanuel <span class="sc">II.</span>, Duke of Savoy and
Prince of Piedmont, against his Protestant subjects of the
valleys of the Cottian Alps.&rsquo; In January, an edict required
them to turn Romanists or quit the country out of hand; it was
enforced with such barbarity that Cromwell took the case of
the sufferers in hand; and so vigorous was his action that the
Edict was withdrawn and a convention was signed (August 1655)
by which the Vaudois were permitted to worship as they would.
Printed in 1673.</p>

<h3><a class="pagebreak" name="page344" id="page344" title="344"></a><a name="note_xv" id="note_xv"></a><a href="#page29">XV</a></h3>

<p>The Nineteenth Sonnet (Masson) &lsquo;may have been written any
time between 1652 and 1655,&rsquo; the first years of Milton's blindness,
&lsquo;but it follows the Sonnet on the Piedmontese Massacre in Milton's
own volume of 1673.&rsquo;</p>

Wrestler), first printed in 1671.</p>

<h3><a name="note_xviii" id="note_xviii"></a><a href="#page31">XVIII</a></h3>

<p>Of uncertain date; first printed by Watson 1706&ndash;11. The version
given here is Emerson's (which is shorter than the original), with the
exception of the last stanza, which is Napier's (<i>Montrose</i>, i. Appendices).
Napier is at great pains to prove that the ballad is allegorical,
and that Montrose's &lsquo;dear and only love&rsquo; was that unhappy King
whose Epitaph, the famous <i>Great, Good, and Just</i>, he is said&mdash;falsely&mdash;to
have written with his sword. Be this as it may, the

For the Great Marquis, who reminded De Retz of the men in
Plutarch's <i>Lives</i>, was not averse from the practice of poetry, and
wrote, besides these numbers, a prayer (&lsquo;Let them bestow on
every airth a limb&rsquo;), a &lsquo;pasquil,&rsquo; a pleasant string of conceits in
praise of woman, a set of vehement and fiery memorial stanzas on
the King, and one copy of verses more.</p>

<p>First printed by Captain Thomson, <i>Works</i> (1776), from a copy
he held, on what seems excellent authority, to be in Marvell's hand.
The true title is <i>A Horatian Ode on Cromwell's Return from
Ireland</i> (1650). It is always ascribed to Marvell (whose verse
was first collected and printed by his widow in 1681), but there
are faint doubts as to the authorship.</p>

<p><i>Poems</i> (1681). This elegant and romantic lyric appears to have
been inspired by a passage in the life of John Oxenbridge, of
whom, &lsquo;religionis causa oberrantem,&rsquo; it is enough to note that,
<a class="pagebreak" name="page345" id="page345" title="345"></a>
after migrating to Bermudas, where he had a church, and being
&lsquo;ejected&rsquo; at the Restoration from an English cure, he went to
Surinam (1662&ndash;67), to Barbadoes (1667), and to New England
(1669), where he was made pastor of &lsquo;the First Church of Boston&rsquo;
(1670), and where he died in 1674. These details are from Mr.
Grosart's <i>Marvell</i> (1875), i. 82&ndash;85, and ii. 5&ndash;8.</p>

<p>Dryden's second Ode for Saint Cecilia's Day, <i>Alexander's Feast,
or the Power of Sound</i>, as it is called, was written and printed in
1697. As it was designed for music (it was set by Jeremiah
Clarke), the closing lines of every strophe are repeated by way
of chorus. I have removed these repetitions as impertinent to
the effect of the poem in print, and as interrupting the rushing
vehemency of the narrative. The incident described is the burning
of Persepolis.</p>

<h3><a name="note_xxiv" id="note_xxiv"></a><a href="#page45">XXIV</a></h3>

<p>Written early in 1782, in memory of Robert Levett: &lsquo;an old
and faithful friend,&rsquo; says Johnson, and withal &lsquo;a very useful and
very blameless man.&rsquo; Excepting for the perfect odes of Cowper
(<i>post</i>, pp. <a href="#page85">85</a>, <a href="#page86">86</a>), in these excellent and affecting verses the
&lsquo;classic&rsquo; note is audible for the last time in this book until we reach
the <i>Iphigeneia</i> of Walter Savage Landor, who was a lad of seven
at the date of their composition. They were written seventeen
years after the publication of the <i>Reliques</i> (1765), and a full quarter
century after the appearance of <i>The Bard</i> (1757); but in style they
proceed from the age of Pope. For the rest, the Augustan Muse
was an utter stranger to the fighting inspiration. Her gait was
pedestrian, her purpose didactic, her practice neat and formal: and
she prosed of England's greatest captain, the victor of Blenheim, as
tamely as himself had been &lsquo;a parson in a tye-wig&rsquo;&mdash;himself, and
not the amiable man of letters who acted as her amanuensis for
the nonce.</p>

<p><i>Chevy Chase</i> is here preferred to <i>Otterbourne</i> as appealing more
directly to Englishmen. The text is Percy's, and the movement
like that of all the English ballads, is jog-trot enough. Sidney's
confession&mdash;that he never heard it, even from a blind fiddler, but it
stirred him like the sound of a trumpet&mdash;refers, no doubt, to an
earlier version than the present, which appears to date from the
first quarter of the seventeenth century. Compare <i>The Brave Lord
Willoughby</i> and <i>The Honour of Bristol</i> (<i>post</i>, pp. <a href="#page60">60</a>, <a href="#page73">73</a>).</p>

that of the vastly better version in <i>The Minstrelsy of the Scottish
Border</i> (1802&ndash;3). Of the &lsquo;history&rsquo; of the ballad the less said the
better. The argument is neatly summarised by Mr. Allingham, p.

<p>Printed by Percy, &lsquo;from an old black-letter copy; with some
conjectural emendations.&rsquo; At the suggestion of my friend, the
Rev. Mr. Hunt, I have restored the original readings, as in
truer consonancy with the vainglorious, insolent, and swaggering
ballad spirit. As for the hero, Peregrine Bertie, Lord Willoughby
of Eresby, described as &lsquo;one of the Queen's best swordsmen&rsquo; and
&lsquo;a great master of the art military,&rsquo; he succeeded Leicester in
the command in the Low Countries in 1587, distinguished himself
repeatedly in fight with the Spaniards, and died in 1601. &lsquo;Both
Norris and Turner were famous among the military men of that
age&rsquo; (Percy). In the Roxburgh Ballads the full title of the broadside&mdash;which
is &lsquo;printed for S. Coles in Vine St., near Hatton
Garden,&rsquo;&mdash;is as follows:&mdash;&lsquo;<i>A true relation of a famous and bloudy
Battell fought in Flanders by the noble and valiant Lord Willoughby
with 1500 English against 40,000 Spaniards, wherein the English
obtained a notable victory for the glory and renown of our nation.</i>

<p>From the <i>Minstrelsy</i>, where it is &lsquo;given, without alteration
or improvement, from the most accurate copy that could be
recovered.&rsquo; The story runs that Helen Irving (or Helen Bell), of
<a class="pagebreak" name="page348" id="page348" title="348"></a>
Kirkconnell in Dumfriesshire, was beloved by Adam Fleming, and
(as some say) Bell of Blacket House; that she favoured the first
but her people encouraged the second; that she was thus constrained
to tryst with Fleming by night in the churchyard, &lsquo;a
romantic spot, almost surrounded by the river Kirtle&rsquo;; that they
were here surprised by the rejected suitor, who fired at his rival
from the far bank of the stream; that Helen, seeking to shield her
lover, was shot in his stead; and that Fleming, either there and
then, or afterwards in Spain, avenged her death on the body of
her slayer. Wordsworth has told the story in a copy of verses
which shows, like so much more of his work, how dreary a
poetaster he could be.</p>

<p>Begun in 1755, and finished and printed (with <i>The Progress of
Poetry</i>) in 1757. &lsquo;Founded,&rsquo; says the poet, &lsquo;on a tradition current
in Wales, that Edward the First, when he concluded the
conquest of that country, ordered all the bards that fell into his
hands to be put to death.&rsquo; The &lsquo;agonising king&rsquo; (line 56) is
Edward <span class="sc">II.</span>; the &lsquo;she-wolf of France&rsquo; (57), Isabel his queen; the
&lsquo;scourge of heaven&rsquo; (60), Edward <span class="sc">III.</span>; the &lsquo;sable warrior&rsquo; (67),
Edward the Black Prince. Lines 75&ndash;82 commemorate the rise and
fall of Richard <span class="sc">II.</span>; lines 83&ndash;90, the Wars of the Roses, the murders
in the Tower, the &lsquo;faith&rsquo; of Margaret of Anjou, the &lsquo;fame&rsquo; of

is symbolical of Richard <span class="sc">III.</span>; &lsquo;half of thy heart&rsquo; (99) of Eleanor
of Castile, &lsquo;who died a few years after the conquest of Wales.&rsquo;
Line 110 celebrates the accession of the House of Tudor in fulfilment
of the prophecies of Merlin and Taliessin; lines 115&ndash;20,
Queen Elizabeth; lines 128&ndash;30, Shakespeare; lines 131&ndash;32, Milton;

the <i>Royal George</i> (108 guns) was overset in Portsmouth Harbour

reading Hume's <i>History</i> in 1780&rsquo; (Benham).</p>

this gallant lyric, which he printed in the <i>Minstrelsy</i>, to a &lsquo;greater

<p>Of these, the first, <i>Blow High, Blow Low</i>, was sung in <i>The
Seraglio</i> (1776), a forgotten opera; the second, said to have been
inspired by the death of the author's brother, a naval officer, in
<i>The Oddities</i> (1778)&mdash;a &lsquo;table-entertainment,&rsquo; where Dibdin was
author, actor, singer, musician, accompanist, everything but
audience and candle-snuffer. They are among the first in time of
his sea-ditties.</p>

<p>The <i>Arethusa</i>, Mr. Hannay tells me, being attached to Keppel's
fleet at the mouth of the Channel, was sent to order the <i>Belle
Poule</i>, which was cruising with some smaller craft in search of
Keppel's ships, to come under his stern. The <i>Belle Poule</i> (commanded
by M. Chadeau de la Clocheterie) refusing, the <i>Arethusa</i>
(Captain Marshall) opened fire. The ships were fairly matched,
and in the action which ensued the <i>Arethusa</i> appears to have got
the worst of it. In the end, after about an hour's fighting,
Keppel's liners came up, and the <i>Belle Poule</i> made off. She
was afterwards driven ashore by a superior English force, and
it is an odd coincidence that in 1789 the <i>Arethusa</i> ran ashore off
Brest during her action (10th March) with <i>l'Aigrette</i>. As for the
French captain, he lived to command <i>l'Hercule</i>, De Grasse's leading
ship in the great sea-fight (12th April 1782) with Rodney off
Dominica, where he was killed.</p>

But Scott Douglas (<i>Burns</i>, iii. 173) has &lsquo;no doubt that this broadside

the work of Burns. The refrain and the metrical structure have

that incomparable ditty, it was written as late as 1825. &lsquo;The air

of 22d December (<i>Diary</i>, 1890, i. 61), &lsquo;I wrote a few verses to it

<p>This unsurpassed piece of art, in which a music the most exquisite
is used to body forth a set of suggestions that seem dictated by
the very Spirit of Romance, was produced, under the influence of
&lsquo;an anodyne,&rsquo; as early as 1797. Coleridge, who calls it <i>Kubla
Khan: A Vision within a Dream</i>, avers that, having fallen asleep
in his chair over a sentence from Purchas's Pilgrimage&mdash;&lsquo;Here
the Khan Kubla commanded a palace to be built and a stately
garden thereto; and thus ten miles of ground were enclosed with
a wall,&rsquo;&mdash;he remained unconscious for about three hours, &lsquo;during
which time he had the most vivid confidence that he could not have
composed less than three hundred lines&rsquo;; &lsquo;if that,&rsquo; he adds, &lsquo;can
be called composition, in which all the images rose up before
him as things, with a parallel production of the correspondent expressions,
without any sensation or consciousness of effort.&rsquo; On
awakening, he proceeded to write out his &lsquo;composition,&rsquo; and had
set down as much of it as is printed here, when &lsquo;he was unfortunately
called out by a person on business from Porlock,&rsquo; whose
departure, an hour after, left him wellnigh oblivious of the rest.
This confession, which is dated 1816, has been generally accepted
as true; but Coleridge had a trick of dreaming dreams about himself
which makes doubt permissible.</p>

belief,&rsquo; he continues, &lsquo;in its authenticity was confirmed by an Englishman,
long resident in Boulogne, lately telling me that he remembered
the circumstance to have been generally talked of in the
<a class="pagebreak" name="page352" id="page352" title="352"></a>
place.&rsquo; Authentic or not, I have preferred the story to <i>Hohenlinden</i>,
as less hackneyed, for one thing, and, for another, less pretentious
and rhetorical. The second (<i>Gertrude of Wyoming</i>, 1809) is truly
one of &lsquo;the glories of our birth and state.&rsquo; The third (<i>idem</i>) I
have ventured to shorten by three stanzas: a proceeding which,
however culpable it seem, at least gets rid of the chief who gave
a country's wounds relief by stopping a battle, eliminates the mermaid
and her song (the song that &lsquo;condoles&rsquo;), and ends the lyric
on as sonorous and romantic a word as even Shakespeare ever
used.</p>

<p>Napier has described the terrific effect of Napoleon's pursuit;
but in the operations before Corunna he was distanced, if not out-generalled,
by Sir John Moore, and ere the first days of 1809
he gave his command to Soult, who pressed us vainly through
the hill-country between Leon and Gallicia, and got beaten at
Corunna for his pains. Wolfe, who was an Irish parson and
died of consumption, wrote some spirited verses on the flight
of Busaco, but this admirable elegy&mdash;&lsquo;I will show you,&rsquo; said

printed, not by the author, in an Irish newspaper; was copied all
over Britain; was claimed by liar after liar in succession; and has
been reprinted more often, perhaps, than any poem of the century.</p>

<p>The <i>Lays</i> are dated 1824; they have passed through edition after
edition; and if Matthew Arnold disliked and contemned them (see
Sir F. H. Doyle, <i>Reminiscences and Opinions</i>, pp. 178&ndash;87), the general
is wise enough to know them by heart. But a book that is &lsquo;a
catechism to fight&rsquo; (in Jonson's phrase) would have sinned against
itself had it taken no account of them, and I have given <i>Horatius</i> in
its integrity: if only, as Landor puts it,</p>

<blockquote class="poetry"><p>

<p>As for <i>The Armada</i>, I have preferred it to <i>The Battle of Naseby</i>,
first, because it is neither vicious nor ugly, and the other is both;
and, second, because it is so brilliant an outcome of that capacity
for dealing with proper names which Macaulay, whether poet or
not, possesses in common with none but certain among the greater
poets. For <i>The Last Buccaneer</i> (a curious anticipation of some
effects of Mr. Rudyard Kipling), and that noble thing, the <i>Jacobite's
Epitaph</i>, they are dated 1839 and 1845 respectively.</p>

<p>and which have been, ever since the imprisonment by James <span class="sc">II.</span> of
the Seven Bishops&mdash;one of them Sir Jonathan Trelawney&mdash;a
popular proverb throughout Cornwall, the whole of this song was
composed by me in the year 1825. I wrote it under a stag-horned
oak in Sir Beville's Walk in Stowe Wood. It was sent by me
anonymously to a Plymouth paper, and there it attracted the notice
of Mr. Davies Gilbert, who reprinted it at his private press at Eastbourne
under the avowed impression that it was the original ballad.
It had the good fortune to win the eulogy of Sir Walter Scott, who
also deemed it to be the ancient song. It was praised under the
same persuasion by Lord Macaulay and Mr. Dickens.&rsquo;&mdash;<i>Author's

heroic death, &lsquo;in the last of August,&rsquo; 1591&mdash;after the Revenge
had endured the onset of &lsquo;fifteen several armadas,&rsquo; and received
some &lsquo;eight hundred shot of great artillerie,&rsquo;&mdash;see Hakluyt (1598&ndash;1600),
ii. 169&ndash;176, where you will find it told with singular animation
and directness by Sir Walter Raleigh, who held a brief against the
Spaniards in Sir Richard's case as always. To Sir Richard's proposal
to blow up the ship the master gunner &lsquo;readily condescended,&rsquo;
as did &lsquo;divers others&rsquo;; but the captain was of &lsquo;another opinion,&rsquo;
and in the end Sir Richard was taken aboard the ship of the Spanish
admiral, Don Alfonso de Bazan, who used him well and honourably
until he died: leaving to his friends the &lsquo;comfort that being
dead he hath not outlived his own honour,&rsquo; and that he had nobly

<p><i>The Return of the Guards, and other Poems</i>, 1866. By permission
of Messrs. Macmillan. As to the first, which deals with an
incident of the war with China, and is presumably referred to in 1860,
&lsquo;Some Seiks and a private of the Buffs (or East Kent Regiment)
having remained behind with the grog-carts, fell into the hands
of the Chinese. On the next morning they were brought before
the authorities and commanded to perform the <i>Ko tou</i>. The Seiks
obeyed; but Moyse, the English soldier, declaring that he would
not prostrate himself before any Chinaman alive, was immediately
knocked upon the head and his body thrown upon a dunghill.&rsquo;&mdash;Quoted
by the author from <i>The Times</i>. The Elgin of line 6 is
Henry Bruce, eighth Lord Elgin (1811&ndash;1863), then Ambassador to
China, and afterwards Governor-General of India. Compare <i>Theology
in Extremis</i> (<i>post</i>, p. 309). Of the second, which Mr. Saintsbury
describes &lsquo;as one of the most lofty, insolent, and passionate
things concerning this matter that our time has produced,&rsquo; Sir
Francis notes that the incident&mdash;no doubt a part of the conquest
of Sindh&mdash;was told him by Sir Charles Napier, and that &lsquo;Truckee&rsquo;

champion of the Persian Kai Khosroo. The challenge is accepted
by Rustum, who fights as a nameless knight (like Wilfrid of Ivanhoe
at the Gentle and Joyous Passage of Ashby), and so becomes
the unwitting slayer of his son. For the story of the pair the poet

Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.

entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
